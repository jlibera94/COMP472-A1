i am computer savy ( i \\'m an engineer ) and i find the new ribbon interface totally infuriating . worst of all there is no way to go back to the \" old \" drop down menu system . it honestly takes me 10x the time to get anything done with word / powerpoint because they \\'ve buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons . ms claims that you will be able to be much more productive once you \\'re familiar with the ribbons . i do n\\'t know / care whether that \\'s true or not . the learning curve to get to the point of fluency with their new ui is immense . so much so that the time investment to become proficient far far far out ways any \" increase \" in productivity....not to mention that it \\'s overpriced . offce 2003 is a far superior product \\r\\n', \" a wonderful wonderful book.although the book was written some 150 year ago , mary eliza rogers takes you into the intimacies of daily life in palestine in the 1850 's as if it was occurring today . she writes from her heart with honesty , integrity and a clear mind . and although written at a time of victorian prejudicies and colonialism she writes without bias or judgement . from her beautiful and colourful descriptions one can envisage the holy land as it was before undergoing the process of modernisation and change . for anyone who has any attachment to this land it is a truly wonderful and personal experience to read this book \\r\\n\", \" i am rating this program just one star because i found out after ordering that it is not compatible with digital voice recorders . i did go to the nuance website before ordering . they did n't have a little chart to tell what the difference was between preferred and standard . anyway , if you want naturally speaking to do transcribing , you need the preferred version , not this one . \\r\\n\", ' he just needs to retire . screw this non-gangsta . no real g sings , they just rap , god \\r\\n', \" i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and does n't smell too much , however , i 've experimented with it several times to confirm my findings , and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads . i 'm 25 with an oily t-zone and very dry facial skin . on mornings after using this cream , i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin . there are better products out there \\r\\n\", ' this camera has a very poor lens . at 1x zoom , the barrel / spherical distortion is enormous ; try taking a picture of a tiled wall . image quality is also so-so when a picture is viewed at 100% ; scaled down on a computer monitor , the quality is ok . color fidelity is next to nothing when using flash and auto white balance .

true that he is working on his latest now . ca n\\'t wait ! buy this cd. . you wo n\\'t regret it \\r\\n', ' the living in oblivion series of cd compilations does something that many similar compilations do not do : they give us some great variety of \" hits \" . there is no doubt that \" mickey \" by toni basil was a huge hit . there \\'s also no doubt that \" our lips are sealed \" was a break out hit for the go go \\'s , but the funboy three version wasn\\'t . but what about \" living in a box \" ? it only hit the billboard top 100 at #89 in 1987. so why is it here ? why are a large number of these songs ? they \\'re not top 10 hits , right ? wrong ! i \\'m sick to death of so many compilations relying on top 40 hits from the 80\\'s . the u.s. music tastes are typically very different from those of europe . just because a song does n\\'t make the u.s. billboard top 40 does n\\'t mean that it is n\\'t a hit in other countries . and although i \\'m an american , my music tastes have always run more in line with those of europe . i \\'m delighted that the living in oblivion series ( and the pop and wave series ) have incorporated a variety of hits from the u.s. and europe . i also like that some of the more obscure groups and their songs are available on these compilations . there are several songs on these albums that never were released on cd ( as they had n\\'t come into being at the time of the groups \\' albums initial releases ) , so albums such as these are the only place where you can find these hits . the boys do n\\'t cry song \" i wanna be a cowboy \" hit the billboard charts at #12 in 1986 , but the group disappeared soon thereafter . then all of a sudden a dance version of that same song came out in the early 2000 \\'s and rocketed up the dance charts . do n\\'t be misled , the living in oblivion series is one of the absolutely best series for a variety of music from the 80\\'s . if you want to hear run of the mill , top 40 only hits from the 80 \\'s , well , then you \\'ll just have to look elsewhere . also , the liner notes and pictures of the groups included in the jewel box are really clever . you get to find out what the chart position was for the songs in the compilation and see what the groups looked like at the time of the song \\'s release . my only issue with these liner notes is that the author of them seems to be disparaging the very music which these albums are espousing . apparently many believe that the music from the 80 \\'s was vacuous and devoid of emotion . one need only listen to the song \" the promise \" by the group \" when in rome \" ( living in oblivion volume 5 ) to know that such a statement is false . while that group only had this one hit and then faded into obscurity , \" the promise \" made the billboard top 100 at #11 and the billboard dance chart at #1. anyway.. . i ca n\\'t recommend this album and its entire series any more ! it \\'s simply awesome ! before believing those who would disparage this series of albums , please check the billboard charts and you \\'ll see that these songs were in fact hits . get it \\r\\n', ' worked fine for standard items . did not handle partnership issues completely . would be good to have a preview of the finished return before printed ( maybe this is possible , but i did not find this function ) . in general , an easy , straightforward program that gets the job done \\r\\n', \" i bought one and it worked great . at first it 's hard to manuever because it 's really hot , and the barrel 's bristles are kinda rough and pull your hair a lot , but once you get used to it , it does a stellar job of straightening your hair . around 6 months into using the straightner , the machine slowly overheated and died . thinking i had a faulty model , i went out and bought a new one . guess what ? a few months into that one , it ended the same way . so basically , not worth it . \\r\\n\", ' this is my first digital picture frame , so i do not have anything to compare it against . i am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use , and i am happy with the resolution and the picture quality . the only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all , and as one other reviewer noted , i had to learn how to do things by trial and error . i also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images , it is not \" saved \" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time . however , i like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next christmas \\r\\n', \" sandra bullock gives an outstanding and believable performance in the role of angela bennett . in this film she plays the part of a solitary and lonely computer expert . an online hacker friend calls to tell her he 's found an amazing disk and is sending it to her to check out . unfortunately , he 's killed in a plane crash before he can visit her . the disk turns out to have secret government information and is wanted by a terrorist group who plan the downfall of the u.s. government . angela bennett recognizes that the disk is something special and before she really realizes what she has , she finds that she 's being stalked . what happens next is everyone 's worst nightmare . through the miracle of computers , the evil group steal angela 's identify and there are few people to vouch for her . the story quickly turns into a cyber thriller . she tries to get help , but she appears to have no friends and does n't even know her own neighbors . her mother ( diane baker ) is in an institution and is apparently suffering from alzheimer's . her former boyfriend , played by dennis miller does try to help her , but the

\\r\\n\", ' a hardcore legend in mick foley \\' wrestling career is spotlighted here on this dvd . foley will go down in history for being able to control the crowd , being violent & hardcore , and also being able to be one of the most loveable characters in wrestling . this dvd is a great collection of violent matches involing foley himself along with his famous promos & extra matches . disc one : cactus jack vs. big van vader - during a time where vader was just killing his opponetts , cactus jack was able to hold his own and go toe to toe with vader . this also includes exclusive footage that was censored on tbs . chicago street fight : cactus jack & maxx payne vs. nasty boys - this was one of the \" stiffest \" matches i \\'ve ever seen as these guys were legitlity brawling & hitting each other with the weapons and you just see at one point cactus get his head cracked with a shovel on the floor . honestly , one of the best nasty boys matches i \\'ve seen . cactus jack vs. sabu - this match was more about the post match brawl between the two than the match itself . foley admits before the match that the hype & reputation between these two set a standard that nobody could match . cactus jack vs. chris candido - one of cactus \\'s best \" wrestling \" matches eventhough it \\'s not really anything memorable . texas death match : cactus jack vs. the sandman - foley openily admits that this match was n\\'t pretty as sandman got a concussion at the beginning & really threw everything off . they would go on to have better matches ( as seen on the ecw cactus jack dvd ) . cactus jack & raven vs. terry funk & tommy dreamer - the classic ecw wild weapons brawl as they had everything including the kitchen sink . it would get sick as you see things like cactus sliceing funk \\'s arm with glass . with cameo \\'s from taz & bill alfonzo , this is worth watching again & again . cactus jack vs. mikey whipwreck - cactus \\' last match in ecw against the man he helped make a superstar . disc 1 extras : post-vader match interview - interview a week after his match with vader falls count anywhere : cactus jack vs. sting - this match has commentary from coach & foley where they talked about his storytelling throughout the match & his time in wcw . this was cactus \\' best wcw match in his opinion and it really is . action all over the ringside area along with great inring storytellin ( watch him work on sting \\'s ribs ) . cactus jack spits on wcw tag team championship belt - the promo cactus did after this sabu match showing that the wcw tag title did n\\'t mean as much as his pride that he lost to sabu . this is followed by a heyman promo regarding that match . the \" cane dewey \" promo - foley \\'s favorite promo done during this \" anti-hardcore \" stint in ecw where he talks about the fans making a sign suggesting that sandman canes his 5 year old son . \" anti-hardcore \" promo - another promo where foley talks down to the ecw fans for being so bloodthirsty . cactus jack vs. sabu - the cactus / sabu rematch that includes commentary from foley & coach . this match is better quality ( both in video & in ring action ) than the previous one . mick foley \\'s ecw farewell speech - foley says goodbye to the ecw fans . \" jack \" \" foley & les thornton vs. british bulldogs - mick \\'s wwe debut that results in his having a dislocated jaw thanks to the dynamite kid . wwe confidential feature - mick talks about all the charity work he did during his 18 month absence in wwe and what led to his coming back to wwe . hidden easter eggs : mick foley jumps off the roof of his house ( on disc one , go to the \" extras \" menu , highlight \" main menu \" and press the left arrow twice . ) dude love entrance video ( on disc one , go to the \" chapters \" menu . highlight \" cactus jack vs. chris candido \" and press the right arrow . ) disc 2 introducting mankind - one of the mankind \" dungeon \" promos he did before his debut mankind vs. shawn michaels - this was foley \\'s best match of his career and probably the best match of 1996. hbk \\'s high flyin \\' lucha libre influenced style mixed with mankind \\'s hardcore daredevil style made for one hell of a match . falls count anywhere : cactus jack vs. triple h - tables , trash cans , and weapons galore in this brawl . one of the best matches in raw history mick foley vs. terry funk - a throwback to their ecw brawls as both of these wrestlers are just using their own bodies are wrecking machines . stone cold on commentary just adds to the craziness of this match . dude love vs. stone cold - the best match in the history of dude love as it \\'s another brawl all over ringside . mcmahon , brisco , patterson , and undertaker all have cameos in this match . mankind vs. the undertaker - foley \\'s most memorable performance as he takes a beating that you have to see to believe . mankind vs. the rock - foley wins the title for the

sustained through 12 books so far , being a case in point . but full scoop was actually a trial to get through . i could hear another voice in there which was distracting and interrupted evanovich 's comedic rhythm . the whole tone of the writing was down about five notches from what i have come to expect from evanovich . the silly villains were either being too goofy or too violent , leaving us wondering were we supposed to be amused or frightened ? the least forgivable of the sins committed in full scoop was the fact that there was absolutely no chemistry between maggie and zack . none at all . so it 's hard to label the book : a sort of but not really romance , an almost but not much of a woman-in-danger... . maybe a new genre altogether - the slapstick thriller \\r\\n\", ' i upgraded

people in that country when it comes to the actions it takes and tolerates around the world . oddly , the fascism of the communist regime remains largely in place in the era following mao \\'s disastrous reign , even as capitalism and other western ideals spread like wildfire through this huge , heavily-populated , and ( from a western perspective ) oftentimes strange land . aikman does an excellent job of covering the basic bullet points of the history of christianity in china , as well as introducing readers to the many chinese christians who have led or continue to lead the church in their country . on a recent trip to china , i was highly impressed by the deep generosity , humility , resourcefulness , strength , perseverance , and kindness exhibited by chinese of all ages . this spirit hums just below the surface in the stories aikman tells of the christian chinese and their faith . this spirit is also , i believe , one of the major reasons why the life and teachings of jesus seem to so easily take root in the hearts of so many chinese . also , those who are concerned that a \" christian china \" would somehow gut the land of its culture and heritage while propping up a westernized facsimile in its place should rest easy . it seems that the faith is spreading through this nation in a very distinctly chinese way \\r\\n', ' i have had this camera since jan \\' 05 and have so far taken approximately 10 , 000 shots while on trips and at weddings . do n\\'t expect much from it and you will be happy . as an entry level dslr it does what it \\'s supposed to do in ideal conditions . i find it \\'s strength is in taking people photographs in bright light , provided that they are not moving . cons : in landscape photography this camera is lacking - both due to inadequate megapixels and it \\'s inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well . battery dies fast . the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting , especially when shooting in raw mode . i have yet to fill up a 1gig card when shooting in raw mode ( approx 150 shots ) before the battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge ( over 300 ) but hardly enough to last a day . i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike . so i always carry a backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . the viewfinder is very dim . when i look through my elan 7 and then through the 300d , it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the 300d \\'s viewfinder . in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap , especially when having to resort to manual focus . autofocus in low light for the 300d is terrible . when shooting indoors , the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject . i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur . this is despite having a 420ex flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus . the 420ex flash is supposed to \" talk \" to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed . however , with the 300d , this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over / under exposed . after about five months , the shutter button started sticking . i would click it and then it would remain depressed . the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little . another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button . and since there is only one thumbwheel , it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed . for example , if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature , then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel . when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera , this is a real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you are a casual point and shoot person , it \\'s an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos . but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately , look elsewhere \\r\\n', ' my 8-month-old son and i listen to this cd every night , and by the pachelbel canon ( track 7 ) he \\'s usually sound asleep . it is not all synthesizer . the jacket clearly states that the \" music box

option is weaker on this one . if you do n't care about the weight go with the ef 24-70 2.8l imho . \\r\\n\", ' i received my 28-200 yesterday from amazon . having read the customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt on a tripod and ran two series of comparison shots with the 28-200 and my canon 28-135 is . three shots each at f-stops 5.6 , 11 , and 20 , one set indoors at iso 1600 and the other outdoors at iso 200. focal length 135 using the same scenes with each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out of the camera , side by side . results : the 28-200 was at least as sharp as the 28-135 in both foreground and background in most instances . it was visibly sharper at iso 200 with f-stops 5.6 and 20 , ( the 28-135 took the honors at f-stop 10 ) , and at 20 , it was visibly sharper in both the foreground and the background . the 28-135 was one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely in photoshop . there are the vagaries of autofocus and different shooting conditions to consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : the 28-200 is as good as it gets for a super-zoom on your canon ( unless you are going to drop $2200 on the l series 28-300 is and carry it ) , and the 28-135 is has no clear sharpness advantage . between these lenses , its a tradeoff- --an extra 65 mm of focal length ( 105 mm after a 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization and low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly and silently , and both lenses produce usable shots . \\r\\n', ' this is one of the worst films ever made ! and i mean it ! ! one of the worst scripts i have ever come across . the acting is hammy and the direction is

winded , but it 's extensive and can be useful . i received the nikon d2h camera - - 2 bodies total - - over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after the d2h system was released in 2003. since then , i have used them to shoot images of all types - - documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , and dead - of - night - - for the paper i work for . this is the only camera i work with . first , please read the manual . there is a ton of information there , and the information is terrific to begin with . the d2h is highly - configurable , with screen after screen that you can set for your own specific use ( resist lending the camera to anyone for a long period of time , for your camera may be returned with many of your settings changed so much that it acts like a thoroughly different camera ) . i 'll just punch right in to the way it feels . the camera is a rather heavy beast , and for some , there can be an amount of shoulder or neck fatigue when using it for hours per day , like i do . but the camera feels well in hand and the controls are easy to move through . i 've long since given up using any camera bag . all i have are a fanny pack for a 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters and 2 extra camera batteries and flashes clipped to its belt . and the d2h 's hold the 17-35mm nikon and the 80-200mm nikon one - touch or the sigma 120-300mm 2 - touch . shooting is a breeze . the batteries let you shoot long before the need to recharge . i have my d2h set on iso 200 or 400 most of the time and sacrifice shutter speed for lower iso as often as i can , because the higher isos bring digital noise and a loss in color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins for photoshop to limit this , and that 's a wonderful thing to invest in with this camera when you must shoot action photography with no flash at iso 800 and above . i now have little problems with capturing images in even barely - limited lighting . i recently shot stars and a plane wing from my seat of an airbus at 36 , 000 feet over the pacific at 30 seconds wide open @ f / 2.8 , and it looks tons better than night shots via the d1h , which lacked the internal digital noise filter . that filter kicks in at around 1 / 2 second and longer exposures , and can make you wait as long as your image you 've shot to strip your long exposure of much of the digital noise . when you shoot this way ( and in general ) , do n't simply react by cranking up iso because you will not be happy with your results . the camera can be loud . at over 7 frames per second , it can make you obvious in a quiet room . shooting sensitive situations can be testy , so limit your shooting to single frames . i wish this camera had an option to silence this camera , but since the mirror has to raise and lower , there 's no chance to do this . am i happy with the d2h ? definitely , yes . are there improvements that can be made ? yes . but the benefits outweigh the drawbacks . people have been bailing out of using the nikon system and going canon , which has some incredible gear , i wo n't deny that . but instead of simply giving up on your system of equipment , learn how to use the d2h well and you 'll be much happier than ever . and that means you should push its qualities to the max while respecting its limitations . for instance , white balance . this can be the best thing for you , or the worst thing you 've ever dealt with , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk and dawn are easy , because you can set the camera to daylight , flash , shadow ( for dusk and dawn times ) and even the fluorescent and incandescent tend to be right in the ballpark . but the horrible mixed light or the street lamps that glow blue / green or orange - red from mercury vapor can be the death of an image if you do n't properly use white balance . preset white balance is king , here . i can get grey , black and white when i preset in mercury vapor light . and i used the preset for any light that the auto white balance setting ca n't figure . there is also a setting to dial in kelvin temps as well ! if you do this ( and i can go on for miles here ) , you 're on your way . so , with trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some of the digital d2h forums and ignore the posts that slam the camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan the camera have not tried to understand it . i can bang off images to disprove where they suggest this camera will fail . when you have decent light , you 'll have a decent image . but when you try to use it without learning how you can maximize the system , you will come about shooting images that are terrible and unprintable . in closing , i have not been paid by anyone , i have no nikon stock and have no outside interest in writing this except that i 'm giving the d2h credit where it 's long overdue \\r\\n\", \" i purchased my first weill recordings in 1960 , the off-broadway threepenny opera , and lenya 's berlin theater songs . i have treasured them all my life . lenya was , of course , incomparable , but ute lemper carries on her special genius . this new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece . john mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even klemperer missed in his masterful kleine dreigroschenmusik . every member of the cast , even the bit roles , is perfect in the characterization . kollo is the first performer since harald paulsen ( the origninal mackie messer ) to bring all of the tradition of viennese operetta to this music . he is a miracle . macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from paulsen . most noteworthy is the jenny of milva . two delightful bonuses in the recording : a reprise in act 2 of seerauber jenny by milva ( the jenny ) and the inclusion of lucy brown 's aria after the jealousy duet . there is brief dialog before most pieces which adds a dramatic integrity to the recording . i cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure \\r\\n\", \" i bought this camera on the recommendation of a store technician over another hp digital . the camera has spent as much time in the repair shop as it has being used . the delay between pictures is incredibly long . the lens / shutter does n't open properly .

trio , 4tt , and sometimes a very loose quintet , and each of these tracks have a different mood , without any presence of a jazz soul , or even a real smell of jazz . maybe the intention of recording these tunes was to make a homage / tribute to mr strayhorn , or maybe a recognition for mr henderson value in the 20th century jazz history as one of the most important hard-boppers ever . but the result was very poor . if you really love joe henderson ( as i appreciate ) , try any of his albums from the 60 's ( as a band-leader or as a sideman ) , mainly those from the blue note era . in time

from his regiment for refusing to go to fight a colonial war in sudan because of his impending marriage . not only his colleagues regard him now as a coward , but also his future wife . he had no choice then but to go to war to prove he is a real man and not a coward . the filmmakers try nothing in terms to bring the material up to date , to our more contemporary ( and one hopes , more enlightened ) attitudes . there 's no post colonial guilt here whatsoever . in some ways , this speaks well of the filmmakers in terms of not trying to tamper with the original material ; in another way , it is a bit shocking seeing such jingoism in a contemporary movie . all of this would n't matter much if the movie was entertaining ; unfortunately , it is only intermittently so \\r\\n\", ' we purchased this camera as a replacement for our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due to a problem with the lens mechanism . naturally , only time will tell if this is any different , but in the meantime , here \\'s what you need to know about this baby : the good : 1 ) size and weight - fits almost comfortably in any pocket . much thinner and lighter than any previous digital camera i \\'ve owned , thus encourages one to carry it most anywhere . the size is also pretty comfortable for one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you did n\\'t need me to tell you this , right ? makes previewing images and taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it does not appear very clear , especially if the subject is not static . however , it is bright and rich in color . 3 ) infolithium - this is sony \\'s name for a battery that tells you how much time it has left - only approximately , of course . if use is consistent , will provide you with a good idea . if you use one function then another then another , it tends to vary much more and is not as useful . 4 ) integrated charger / usb station - a flimsy plastic cradle takes care of charging the on-board battery as well as providing a usb hookup for downloading images and video into the computer . minimizes wires and removes the need for a separate charger , though the bright white color is far from a match . the bad : 1 ) focusing problems - the camera cannot focus on objects that are relatively close to it . i am not speaking about macros , but simply the function - or lack thereof - to focus on small , near objects , such as coins , stamps , or text . quick focus on objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed the infolithium as a positive , but the fact that you cannot just pop-in a couple of aa batteries means you will always need the station or the plug to charge up if you need some juice . i do n\\'t know if the battery is universal , but even if it is , it will cost substantially more to purchase a replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i will not complain about sony \\'s desire to make consumers pay more for its cards than adopting a standard , but this camera uses the memorystick duo , which is about 1 / 4 or so smaller than the \" regular \" memorystick . this means that the hundreds you may have invested in memory cards for previous sony digital cameras are pretty useless , as they do not fit into this or any other device using the smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - the flash is tiny , thus does not provide adequate illumination in the dark . within a few feet is okay , but farther subjects are not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c\\'mon , this is 2005 ! 3x optical zoom is pretty pathetic for such an expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there is a decent pause between pictures , meaning you not be able to shoot at a rapid rate . you can certainly take pictures in bursts , but it takes even longer to write to the memory stick . previewing the images is also slow . this is also disappointing , as it \\'s not faster than my older p52. 7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish to use a tripod , you have to mount the camera on the plastic station , then connect the tripod to the plastic dock . this is far from ideal . well , there you have it . the negatives i listed may be insignificant for you , in which case this could be a great value for you . i am certainly happy with it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows with changing standards , compatibilities , and dubious long-term quality \\r\\n', \" like most people i got this camera because it is quite compact for the quality of the image . i 've been pleased with the image quality when it works , but from the start it 's felt flimsy and felt like it would die with any rough treatment . sure enough : * the shutter cover has often stuck open or shut . * sometimes it refuses to start at all . * it sometimes powers on as you 're putting it into your pocket , which opens the barrel which has got to damage the camera . * finally , the lcd stopped working altogether . this is after 8 months . casio has decided i 'm not under warranty ( no explanation as to why , no phone number to argue with them ) , and is charging me $97 to repair it . do n't be seduced ! it 's a poor quality product \\r\\n\", ' updike failed to hold my attention throughout the story both because of its utter lack of suspense in any dimension and the inconsistencies in his character development . as other have stated , you know from page one that the final page will involve an arab , a truck and a bomb . the lack of anticpation must therefore be compensated for by something else - perhaps excellent writing , interesting character development or original insights . updike fails to deliver on all three counts . one particularly slipshod literary technique updike uses is the phrasing he gives the title character ahmad . when ahmad speaks , it is in the voice of an intelligent , thoughtful foreigner . his phrasing captures very well the cadence , vocabulary and grammar of a well spoken non-native speaker of english . curiously , ahmad is an american , raised in new jersey by a thoroughly american mother . so , what influences created this stilted phrasing ? updike is trying to somehow comvince us that a jersey teenager speaks like a pakistani or egyptian immigrant . there is no need for the technique and its inconsistency with the character \\'s life is grating . updike also relies heavily on ethnic / religious stereotypes . sterotypes often have some basis in fact but generally make for uninteresting literature . however , in updike \\'s case , the stereotypes make little sense at all . for instance , a high school counselor \\'s entire personality is attributed to his \" jewishness \" both by himself and by others who opine on his personality . this is particularly curious given that the man was not raised as a jew and , in fact , his family had rather adamently turned away from the religion two generations earlier . so where does all the jewsih influence come from ? likewise , ahmad \\'s mother \\'s personality is often linked to her irish heritage . yet there is no evidence whatsoever that her irish background ( which could have been many generations ago ) has influenced her one bit . the reader is left once again to wonder what motivates the stereotype - other than simply poor writing and careless character development . another out of place literay technique involves the inclusion of fairly lengthy passages from the korna in arabic . obviously , few western readers will understand arabic and it seems meerely pretensious for updike to include the original language rather than paraphrasing or translating the passages . what comes across is an attempt by the autohr to show he has done his research . if that is truly the point then the reader must wonder why the passages are reproduced in western script rather than arabic script . after all , the koran is not written with western phonetics in mind . ultimately , the book leaves one wondering why such a lightweight , poorly constructed piece was released by such a skilled author \\r\\n', \" i will never purchase another neutrogena product , again . there products are dangerous ! ! ! it burned my

last year i use taxcut because of it . first of all , it would not allow me to e-file my state return but did n't explain why . i later discovered that for most states you apparently ca n't e-file a partial year return . then when printing out the state return it told me i had to also include a form that was mentioned nowhere else in the program . i later found out that taxcut does not support all state tax forms ! i then had to get that form and fill it in manually , and then discovered i owed less than before because taxcut had incorrectly calculated my capital gains . and there was nothing on the missing state form that could not have been completed with data the program already had . taxcut also advised me i could save $1000 off my fed bill by contributing to an ira . so i opened and ira and contributed $4000. when i went back to taxcut and entered the details it told me i was n't eligible for any tax deduction . i was ready to be tied up ! this software is seriously dysfunctional . i 'm guessing by this stage you get the idea . bottom line : i will be looking elsewhere to complete my tax returns next year . oh , by the way , if like me you were unable to efile

puts us tv to shame . like bergman \\'s \" scenes from a marriage \" & \" fanny & alexander , \" von trier \\'s \" the kingdom , \" fassbinder \\'s \" berlin alexanderplatz , \" kusturica \\'s \" underground , \" and petersen \\'s \" das boot , \" the decalogue was initially conceived as a series on television and eventually brought to us viewers \\' attention on the large screen via a limited art house run . unlike these other series , kieslowski \\'s was conceived as ten separate stories that were only tied together by the fact that the stories all involved people in the same housing block ( and characters from one episode may pop up in another ) . the stories of the dekalog are morality plays , but they are not re-enactments of the ten commandments , but rather inspired by them , and ultimately it is left to the viewer to decide the connection between the two . kieslowski & piesiewicz wrote the ten screenplays and decided to do the 10 stories themselves ( instead of contracting 10 of poland \\'s best up & coming director \\'s to do each , as was initially planned ) , and instead hired a different cinematographer for each of the stories . i wo n\\'t comment on the content of the stories as many have already done so , and i feel that that would minimizes the impact of the experience of watching them , so i will comment on kieslowski \\'s style . kieslowski has stated that his intent is to highlight personal consequences of a dramatic nature . his films often tackle issues of political import , however he intentionally avoids making \" issue films , \" but rather focuses on the personal consequences of those affected , as he feels that politics solves nothing & that films do not really change the political culture . his views on film stem from his experience as a director who stayed in poland before , during & after the solidarity movement . initially he started as a documentary film maker , but as he saw that audiences were more interested in fiction and that documentary film-making has an impact on the lives of its subjects , he switched to his unique fictional style . this facets 3-disc set of the dekalog is apparently an improvement over the 2-disc version previously available , in that the picture quality is a little better , however it is still a far cry from what it could have been if criterion had released this series . first , facets has a mandatory ad for itself that automatically plays when you insert a disc & you have to let it play out before you can get to the menu . to add to that , you also have to watch another ad each and every time you select an episode to watch & after the end of each episode , very annoying . then the picture quality is n\\'t as good as it could be . not only is there evidence of flaws in the film ( scratches and blotches ) , but the film is n\\'t a true digital copy of the original series , but rather a copy of someone \\'s pal tape of the broadcast , so the image is no better than watching a vhs tape . the picture is also cropped from the original , especially on the bottom . the picture at times jitters , especially during the ending credits . the english subtitles are minimal , at times missing dialogue , and can not be turned off . there are some nice extra features , particularly a broadcast from polish television of an interview of kieslowski with a number of polish journalists . however the quality of the picture of this is worse than on the dekalog , and the entire dialogue is spoken over by people in english with no option to turn of the english dub & use subtitles instead . apparently all of the other ( imported ) editions of the dekalog are of better quality & offer more extras than this edition , which is inexcusable given the price \\r\\n', ' after carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on amazon and reading all reviews i had hoped i had made a good choice with this cd . unfortunately i discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my bose tri-port headphones . as a recording engineer i recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground . the bottom line is i hear this rumble each and everytime i start to relax and it renders the cd completely useless to me . the recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic . since nobody else has complained of this rumble , i will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear \\r\\n', \" dr. scholl 's pedicure essentials cracked skin repair cream had a very nice smell and felt

heard from sonata arctica and it \\'s still my favorite . i \\'m not really really big on power metal / epic metal , but i defintely enjoy sa and kamelot . with that said , i think this cd can even entertain those not interested in power metal . my friend enjors radio rock and rap , but after hearing me play this cd where we work , he begged me to make him a copy . towards the actual cd , i \\'m not quite sure i can put what \\'s in it into words . songs like silver tongue and broken have a very distinct , unique sound . the ballads , draw me and the misery are both superb efforts , each making the listener feel tony kakko \\'s pain . my favorite song would have to be a dead heat between the misery and gravenimage . the keyboardist in this band works in overdrive in each song . he plays fast , and keeps the melody in each beautiful and interesting ( and lighthearted at times ) . the guitarist plays very fast when he needs to , and the right power chords other times . he \\'s quite good . overall , the sound they eminate is as uplifting as it is rocking . they do a great job . the lyrics seem much better than older releases ( english lessons ? ) but still can be a bit odd . \" ...with long haired drummer in band \" springs to mind . still at least they write about mundane things.. . i love kamelot , but the knight in shining armor routine will get old eventually . anyway , the vocals are very well done , he obviously quite talented and the band harmonizes quite well , too . ( they \\'d make queen jealous ! ) overall , i ca n\\'t praise this cd enough . every song is an adventure , none of them a tedious or unnecessary one at that . i would say that anyone could enjoy this cd , but i \\'d first recommend it to those who are tired of the american screamfest metal that \\'s going on today . then i \\'d recommend it to power metal fans , and so on . simply put , this is one of the best cds i own . give it a chance \\r\\n', ' here \\'s a real-review : *the first 100 pages are about how her mother made her get a nose job that when wrong . *the second 100 pages are about the frankenstein movie . *the last 90 pages are about every movie-star that \\'s ever gotten cosmetic surgery . and the whole thing is stitched together with an english teacher \\'s weekend theory on how a mix of \" simulations and simulacra \" + \" the ego and the id \" explain why people get cosmetic surgery . if you \\'re someone who orders books online based on catchy titles , then do yourself a favor and skip this one . how can a book on cosmetic surgery not even talk about the golden ratio ? \\r\\n', \" i have been using omnipage for several years at my law office and found that the ocr with this version is impeccable . i frequently scan and ocr newspaper and magazine articles . they are multi-column and the magazine articles typically have graphics and tables or charts . when i convert them into word documents i seldom get any formating errors . in fact , because the ocr is so good i have set up a batch process to run at night to ocr all the day 's work so my computer resoiurces are n't being taxed when i am in the office working . way to go nuance \\r\\n\", \" ordered this item on sept 28. they were supposed to ship it within 1 week . after 1 week i received an email , they said they needed 2 more weeks . another email today ( nov 7 ) , they think they can deliver it by november 27. that 's 2 months after i placed my order . at this point , i am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year . fortunately with amazon , they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order , which is what i am going to do right now \\r\\n\", ' canon has three digital cameras for $2 , 500+. the 1ds mark ii , the 1d mark iin and the relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i \\'ve shot most of my photographic life ) because of canon \\'s more impressive suite of lenses . here \\'s the decision process i went through . as with most products , it comes down to how you \\'ll use it . all of them have tradeoffs . 1. megapixels . more pixels - with a few caveats - translates into an image that can be enlarged ( and cropped more tightly ) with less deterioration . the 1ds is the market leader at 16.7mp , the 5d comes in at 12.7mp and the 1d at 8.2mp . if you \\'re a commercial art or magazine photographer the 1ds probably makes sense . if you \\'re a wedding photographer , the 5d is probably the sweet spot . in practice , however , the difference in pixels between these cameras will not make an appreciable difference for most people . at 8.2mp , you can make an 11x17 print at 200 pixels / inch without any enlargement beyond the camera \\'s native resolution . up to that size , you certainly wo n\\'t see much difference in prints from the three cameras . that said , the higher megapixels of the other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2. full frame . the 1ds and 5d are full frame - that means the sensor in the camera will capture the view of the scene that you \\'re accustomed to seeing with your 35 mm film camera . the 1d and most digital cameras have what is called a field of view crop factor ( fovcf ) . for the 1d , it \\'s 1.3x . what that means is that both the viewfinder and the image sensor do n\\'t capture everying the lens is \" seeing \" - it crops the view in a little tighter . the result : your lenses are effectively 1.3x longer . a 70 mm lens becomes a 91 mm lens and so on . because the camera is effectively \" cropping \" the edges of the image that the lens produces , it also tends to eliminate the softness or vignetting that appears at the edges of some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see in the viewfinder is still what you get , and it does n\\'t affect the pixel resolution of the image . my 300 mm lens with a 1.4x extender and a 1.3x fovcf is effectively a 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you \\'re switching from film to digital , some of your lenses may may no longer fit your needs with the focvf . your 35 mm lens is no longer really a wide angle at 45 mm . ) 3. durability . this was most important to me , though it may not be for someone who does n\\'t shoot in extreme conditions or expects to replace their camera in two years . both the 1ds and 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against the weather with a shutter that will last at least 200 , 000 cycles . the 5d - a very solid camera - is designed for 100 , 000 , is not weather sealed and has more plastic components . 4. weight / size . what a solid , metal body giveth in durability it taketh away in weight . for those who prefer a camera with heft , these have it . for many people , this is a big drawback . the 1ds and 1d are 43 oz . , or almost three pounds for just the body , without the big battery . add the battery and you \\'re at 54 oz . the 5d is just 29 oz . and 31 oz . with battery . the 1ds and 1d , with built-in vertical grips , are also more than 2 inches taller . if you \\'re looking for something less obtrusive and easier to carry around , the 5d is it . 5. speed . there \\'s a reason the 1d is the camera of choice for photojournalists , sports and many bird photographers . it shoots at a smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared to 4 fps for the 1ds and 3 fps for the 5d . for most day-to-day uses , 3 fps is more than adequate . from using both , i \\'d say the 1d autofocuses a bit faster , too . the 1d has 45 autofocus points , compared to nine for the 5d . 6. price . give or take a hundred here or there , the 1ds is about $7 , 200 ; the 1d about $3 , 900 ; and the 5d about $3 , 000. price will determine whether you get the 1ds or not . if you can afford it , go for it . otherwise , other features - or the possiblity of buying more lenses instead of more camera - will make your decision . what did i decide ? first , i looked at how i \\'d use the camera : photojournalism , travel and wildlife photography . the higher fps was not as important to me as durability and autofocus speed , so either the 1d or 1ds would do . in the end , i decided i \\'d rather spend the money on lenses that would not be obsolete with the next new and improved camera . ( i bought the 300 f / 2.8 is for close to the difference in price . ) so , i went with the 1d mark iin . if my camera was generating some good cash flow or my wife did n\\'t need a new car , i \\'d probably have gone with the 1ds . i \\'m very happing with the decision and the camera . for most people and most uses - general portrait , landscape and travel photography - the 5d is probably the way to go .

play again . i wish there was an option where you could choose to repeat it on its own a few times so you dont have to stop every time to play it again . the other thing is something a little more important . the product has a program where you could go online to down load a lot of songs to play , its called olga . well this website is having legal problems and is not online anymore . so you dont have that option of learning to play your favorite songs from the beetles or metalica or the grateful dead or anyone else , and thats what they advertise \" play hit songs \" . so overall ,

the sisters , mae nak , art of the devil series ) . the film focuses on tun and his girlfriend jane . tun , a photographer reunites with his old friends . on the way home , they accidentally hit a girl with their car and from then on , tun sees ghostly apparitions whenever he takes pictures or whenever he tries to develop them . ok , i am not spoiling anything , the story is more complex than it sounds . tun and his friends have a past that catches up to them , with jane caught in the middle . as usual , there is a vengeful spirit going around killing people . \" shutter \" refers to his

not following basic christian principles . if tyler perry manages to tone down the swearing in his semi-christian plays , why would n\\'t this movie director have enough sense to follow suit...if you \\'re trying to actually sale to a christian audience . furthermore , i thought the bible said a little something against divorce ; like it was n\\'t permitted unless your spouse commits adultery / fornication . this movie seems to say it \\'s okay to go against the word of god if you \\'re in love . in fact , christianity was more of a theory in this movie than it was a practice....by even the protagonist ! i laugh as i think of the scene where ce-ce peniston \\'s character says seductively , \" i \\'m looking for a man with his mind on jesus \" yet she \\'s dressed like a hooker . speaking of clothing , why did ce-ce seem to change outfits even in the middle of scene . they go on a date and she \\'s dressed one way , by the time they come home she has on something different ; with no logical explanation . and please explain why they had someone \\'s grandfather playing the role of rico suave . maybe the movie would have actually been worth while had he looked more like the man of any woman \\'s dream . i felt more like telling him about aarp than i did falling in love with him . in addition , the soundtrack , it-was-just-annoying . at some parts it was even hard to hear what the characters were saying because of the music . i just wanted the maddness to stop ! lastly , it seems as if the director tried to portray single church women as being overwhelmingly desperate ( although some are ) however , having pamela fall so quickly for bryant was just , well , almost juvenile...perhaps even a disrespect to women at large . overall , this movie made me want to puke . pastor larry \" flash \" jenkins really needs to get some true insight on the conditions of the church and maybe even go back and read the bible for himself for clarity \\r\\n', \" you wo n't have to

film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes . unless you are doing a research paper on american sci-fi cinema , or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid , or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies , avoid this dull piece of drivel . i feel cheated ! \\r\\n', \" this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths , and underlying the story are indeed echoes , sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted , of ancient myths . god is allegorized as gabalawi , the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs . the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters . the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel ; the second that of moses and pharaoh ; the third that of jesus ; the fourth that of muhammad . then there is a fifth story , in which the central figure , a ` magician ' , is presumably a scientist . he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it , but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi ` who had been easier to kill than to see' . it makes no difference : the scientist , who has invented a weapon of great destructive power , is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer , and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever , though they remain hopeful that one day ` magic ' will put an end to their suffering . subtle the book is not , either in content or in style ; and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive . the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names , but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another . a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent . they mostly ` shout ' , ` scream ' , ` shriek ' , ` yell ' , ` cry ' or ` sneer ' , which becomes rather tiresome . the literary quality of this novel is , i think , greatly inferior to mahfouz 's rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature . but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written : it has been banned in egypt ; its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author 's life . \\r\\n\", ' warning ! i resized my partition and when it restarted my computed

for \" 3 to 5 years \" to take the place of their mafia boss accused of murder because he bears a striking resemblance to him . they \\'ll pay him yearly and satisfy his lifelong dream of fishing on a boat . joe mantegna ( jerry ) takes don ameche ( gino ) on a 3 day vacation to satisfy his every wish before he \\'s incarcerated . joe mantegna is on probation from the mob , after disobeying orders from a previous job . joe mantegna goes \" outside channels \" to take don ameche ( gino ) to lake tahoe to the \" galaxy \" hotel where they stay , wine and dine , and try to have a good time . things turn difficult when a local real mafia boss brings don ameche ( gino ) to his house as a guest and they form a bond . the real mafia boss has a gathering of crime bosses planned and don ameche and joe mantegna are caught in the middle . they escape the gathering and on the day don ameche is brought back to chicago , joe mantegna is ordered to kill don ameche and make it look like a suicide . \" it \\'s cleaner this way.. . \" , he \\'s told . joe mantegna refuses the order , and the film ends with a mafia employee testifying in court and getting sentenced to jail for 20 years to life . the good : joe mantegna is an underrated actor generally and it was nice to see a familiar face in the real mafia boss in lake tahoe . other than that , there \\'s nothing else going for this one except a slightly funny scene with the concierge . the bad : the mob wants tough guys , right ? this is a comedy , right ? no ones a tough guy and there \\'s no laughs . joe mantegna plays a sissy instead of a mafia tough guy . don ameche plays a senile acting senior with no personality . i wanted to like this film but i coulde n\\'t because it was very slow , very boring and none of the characters were interesting . we never have a scene with the real mafia boss that looks like don amecha and the two never meet . you would expect a friendly \" thanks for going to jail for 3 to 5 years for me \" but it does n\\'t happen . at the end someone for the mob is dressed up like the real mafia boss and he \\'s testifying in court and gets sentenced to jail . he does n\\'t look anything like don ameche or the real mafia boss and yet , he \\'s right there taking the fall . if the film did n\\'t need to depend on don ameche \\'s appearance , why did n\\'t they send him to jail from the beginning ? the worst david mamet experience i \\'ve had . very surprising stinker . the characters : if don ameche played a less passive character he would have been more interesting . if joe mantegna showed more conflict as a character with reasons behind them , he would have been more interesting . as the film stands , they \\'re both flat . don ameche had no personality and his only lines are the ones other characters used . when a character says something , you can be sure don ameche repeats it 30 minutes later like a senile robot . don ameche \\'s dialogue leaves a lot to be desired . add to that his boring and stale acting in this film . he played very dumb , not interesting , like a real man in crisis about to go to jail for money . overall , joe mantegna was not believable as a mafia hired hand . don ameche was too passive and uninteresting , and joe mantegna is too passive and stale . scene criticism : a couple scenes stand out as being very weak and unrealistic . ( gas station scene where joe mantegna is given $3 more in gas than he asked for ) joe mantegna is working for the mob , and he asks for $1 of gas , and gets $4. he does n\\'t have the cash to pay , and when the gas attendant takes the car keys his reaction is \" please , please , please \" a real mob guy would punch the gas attendant , take back the keys , and leave for the plane they were late for . a mob guy that wo n\\'t defend himself for $3 ? ( scene with don ameche offered money to go to jail for 3 to 5 years ) don ameche does n\\'t put up a fight or try to leave the room , and is too passive . we do n\\'t learn about his past or his life or family . there \\'s not enough time spent on the offer , and the scene was over valued for it \\'s lasting value . ( bedroom scene with joe mantegna trying to let don ameche escape ) joe mantegna had no real connection to don ameche \\'s character to justify the scene . instead it \\'s 2 strangers . personal commentary : the test for a comedy for me is - \" how many times did i laugh ? \" this film never made me laugh . i \\'m shocked the film costs $24.99 on dvd . rent it instead . it belongs in the $1 bin at wal-mart . writing criticism : lines like \" he \\'s the guy behind the guy behind the guy behind the guy \" and lines like \" a big man knows the value of a small coin \" and the story about the grasshopper and the ant make no sense . the writing is drivel . alternative recommended film : \" trading places \" with dan aykroyd and eddie murphy and also don ameche , albeit in a smaller role \\r\\n', ' although i have used many electronic cuff devices in the past , this is one of the worst at providing accurate readings . firstly , the cuff is not adequate for very small or larger wrists and the readings are often lower than what you would get if the blood pressure were taken manually the traditional way . in a clinical setting , it is important that you get adequate readings so that the patient can receive the proper treatment based on their readings . it is imperative since you may or may not give medication depending on what you recive via the blood pressure measurement . i have taken a blood pressure manually after getting what i considered a questionable reading only to discover that the wrist blood pressure was far too low and more aggressive measures had to be taken because of the data that was retrieved the old fashioned way . imagine had i taken the initial reading as truth and the patient may have had a stroke as a result . as a rule , i never recommend using these devices for at home use because of the risk of false readings . many people who suffer from hypertension feel that this is a good way of monitoring their blood pressure when in actuality it is giving them a false sense of security . if you are considering buying this product for at home use or for use in a clinical setting , please ask your doctor or nurse for their opinions . \\r\\n', ' \" i have been a brickman fan since the very first album . much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much \" electronic enhancement . \" escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums . there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano . if you are a brickman fan , this is a must have album . \\r\\n', \" this is the best reference i 've seen for it interviews . i 've seen many of these questions at interviews and at one it appeared they had pulled questions from the book . the technology specific questions are excellent \\r\\n\", ' what a terrible excuse for music from generally excellent musicians . it sounds like espn called them asked them to put a diddy together and 10 minutes later....presto ...instant mush \\r\\n', ' this item was offered as a suggested accessory to the nikon monarch atb 8x42 waterproof binoculars that i purchased . i later also purchased the 12x42 binoculars . this harness can not be attached to either pair of binoculars ! the hook part of the snap is too thick to go through the strap eyelet on the binoculars . other than that the harness is a well made quality product \\r\\n', \" this is a very good racing simulator ! but it 's no arcade game so if you want to jump into a car and race around with little or no practice this is not the game for you ! it will take you time to perfect the driving skills and learn the handling characteristics of the various cars . you 're going to need a good wheel and pedal combo to get the most of this game . graphics are very good , but the race car physics and handling are exceptional . highly recommended for racing sim fans , not recommended for the casual race game player \\r\\n\", ' the cover over the lense broke / small lcd screen / pictures are pritty good / battery life is pritty good / some images can come out a bit blurry if theres no flash and your hands arnt that steady / takes nice portaits / easy to use / has a veiw-finder \\r\\n', ' i bought this item to be used with my sony hdr-hc3 camcorder in combination the fig rig . it works as advertised . i do wish the clamp portion of the item was removeable , but it can be worked around . i found the remote to be very responsive , as you would expect from sony . and the price was a bargin . \\r\\n', ' this was by far a great program , and never had a problem with it loading on our computer . fast installation and very easy to work with . plenty of available online , over the phone , or program tutorial help ! awesome program , even comes with a tshirt and 2 transfers \\r\\n', ' what has happened to the song \" lives in the balance \" on this set ?

) . the extended mix is great and available on the 1997 emi remastered release of hounds . mother stands for comfort is a little out of place , dark and eerie it would have felt right at home on the dreaming . kates vocals are , in my opinion , sublime on this track . the fantastic song , cloudbusting , nearly deserves a review on it 's own . a masterpiece in modern pop , it tells one of the best stories i 've ever heard in a pop song , and combines it with one of the best video clips i 've ever seen . the ninth wave is beyond review . you need to buy this lp and listen to it over and over again . it will mean different things to different people , and i think that is what makes it so amazing . commonly interpretted as the story of a woman drowning , i have weaved several meanings through the story at various times of my life , but each ends happily - the whimsical the morning fog makes sure of it.. . else , just put it on and lose yourself in the soundscape , read nothing into it and take the ninth wave for a musical ride . that 's my favourite way to listen to it . finally , if you ever need to test the ability of a piece of sound equipment , say the $2000 amplifier you 're about to splurge on , take the remastered lp as your test . the percussion should be clear , the vocals crisp and the stereo separation precise . an outstanding lp in every way !

and unlike many leonard books , the supporting cast of characters is n\\'t particularly memorable . even leonard \\'s trademark strong dialogue is mostly missing , subsumed by his attempt to stick to period speech . ultimately , one gets the feeling that leonard was most interested in capturing the vibe of the period , and perhaps did n\\'t spend nearly the same amount of effort on the actual story . that said , the depression and its effects are surprisingly absent from the story , given the time and place . all in all , unless you \\'re really really into the whole \\' 30s gangster thing , not worth the time . \\r\\n', ' read the reviews and picked the elephant for my 17m old child \\'s nusery . i absolutely love it . before this , my son could not sleep well with our \" family \\'s \" humiifier because it was too noisy . within an hour of bringing this home , it was set up ( very easily ) and he took one of many 2 1 / 2 hour naps that week !

construction ) . the glass is also descent quality . about the performance , it absorbs some uv light . the uv light absorbtion is hardly noticeable , probably the sky 1-a and the haze filter version will absorb more uv light than this lens which is fine for me . now , about the one problem which is the internal reflection . i 've heard many people say that it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out that it is not caused directly by the low light / night situation . the internal reflection will appear when there is a strong / bright source of light in comparison to the overall exposure ( the surrounding environment ) . to put it in example ( which hopefully is easier to understand ) , when you take a picture of a lamp during nightime and the light is much brighter than the surrounding area then you will see the internal reflection . as you move the position of the light to be closer to the sides / corner of the picture ( and not in the center of the picture ) , the internal reflection reduces and finally dissapear ( if you move the light far enough from the center ) . and if the light is n't too bright / contrast compare to the surrounding environment then there will be no internal reflection . but of course most of the time , a lamp at nightime is often very bright . but the point that i 'm trying to make is that the internal reflection does n't happen all the time during low light or night time . additionally , the internal reflection is n't only happening at night . it can also happen in the afternoon if you are taking a picture of a sun for example . basically same rule as above , on how bright is the light source compared to the surrounding area , and as you move the sun from the center of the photo and near the side the internal reflection will move to the side / dissapear ( also depending the angle ) . but the best way is just to remove the filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you to reduce the occurence of internal reflection by identifying correctly when the internal reflection will occur and then remove the filter during those situation ( which is not hard to do ) . i 'm actually not a fan of lens filter ( any filter ) as i think it will only degrade picture quality as we added another layer between the sensor and object , but i decided to use them anyway for all my lens . and i would recommend everyone to get one of this filter if you do n't have any filter for your lens yet . \\r\\n\", ' the lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft ,

petain and laval quite thoroughly . you may recognize some of ophuls \\' interviewees from the world at war ( such as edward spears ) , but the stand out individual here was the fellow who volunteered for the ss . i assume he served in the charlemagne outfit . frankly , i was surprised he was alive and actually showing his face . his point that the slaughter of 1 , 600 french sailors by the english was a motivating force for him to join the germans was something i would have never considered . it seems inconceivable back then for the french to have even hesitated siding with anybody other than england- -given the competition- -but it is clear that anglophobia was rampant after \" the rout \" of may 1940. the most sensational thing about this film is the footage of the collaborationists . it seems as if modern history has made great attempts to cover up just how much the citizenry backed petain ( at first ) and looked sympathetically to the nazis . the speeches , the newsreels , and the

row . i wo n\\'t go into the details of williamson \\'s ordeal , but i will say that grisham has written a pretty cut-and-dried book , that probably would have been handled better by career crime writers , but is still interesting nonetheless . he does a good job giving the details of ron \\'s case and what he and his family had to go through as events unfolded and ron suffered from growing mental issues . grisham did n\\'t even think about writing ron \\'s story until after ron passed away , so there are no interviews to draw upon , but he does a decent job of tying it all together . i will also say that although he is anti-death penalty , he does n\\'t hammer that opinion at you . he lets the story itself do the talking . i \\'m actually interested in how this book will impact the quality of grisham \\'s next novel , as he \\'ll have actually gone almost 3 years between novels by that time . hopefully the break will result in a more classic work like \" the firm \" or \" a time

instance - which happens to be from 1987 as well - and several de palma films . do n\\'t ask me why . it just does . useless considerations apart , \" wall street \" , directed by always controversial oliver stone , pictures the almighty frenzy in corridors of high finance where no one has a chance to fade away . they always burn out , in a snap of fingers . and bigger they are , harder they fall , right ? the story in itself is nothing new or previously unseen , featuring a bright young \" sport \" , bud fox ( played by charlie sheen ) who happens to have a lot of potential but is not exactly happy with his stock broker life . he wants more , and hotshot gordon gekko ( michael douglas ) is another broker who embodies everything he wants to become - powerful , vicious , influential and a sure winner . by sheer force of will and unprecedented persistence , bud sneaks into gekko \\'s office and tries to prove his value to him . from here on the bulk of the movie shows us the average - but rather well executed in this particular instance - story of the young protegé who rises to the top at breakneck speed until , unexpectedly , something shatters his bond to the master . something that hits home and makes bud question his beliefs . what this is and how it plays out is the very heart of the movie , so i \\'ll let that for you to find out if you did n\\'t see it yet . all the acting is quite superb , especially the relationship between gekko and fox . martin sheen - who is charlie sheen \\'s father both in real life and on the screen - is particularly compelling as a man who believes in hard work , not selling out and not letting others - and yourself - down . he reminds me of donald sutherland simply because he also seems to have that ability to outshine everyone

of goofy , i guess , but it \\'s very hard for me to dislike a character like her . ) audrey hepburn played her to perfection . the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards . i love the film \\'s dialogue as well , it has a very realistic quality , and it \\'s so fun to hear the characters converse with each other . \" breakfast at tiffany \\'s \" is perhaps the

on the toolbar . when clicking on the tabs , it sets up across the toolbar , all of the functions of that particular tab . once viewed , you not only see the words of the functions , but also , small

be much quicker than what i had in the 2003 version . in outlook , setting up accounts , maintaining names and addresses is much easier too . the only annoying part of office 2007 that comes to mind is , one can only choose from 3 color schemes . the three are \" black \" which really looks more like a dark taupe or slate color , \" blue \" which looks more like a light powder blue and \" silver

, she \\'s unique in her genre . but she really shines as a classicist , with classics , her work by andrew lloyd webber ( who she married ) and operatic albums . this is what she \\'s best at , so her collaborations on eden and la luna , which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically , turned out good . i have a lot of her albums , but i would n\\'t buy this one .

downloading small updates , this seems to load only a small part of the program and downloads huge files . this made me feel that the product was shipped unfinished . you had to do this separately for each machine since it hides the downloaded files then deletes them prior to finishing the installation . this took a better part of an afternoon . 2. i purchased a 3-pack license . installing and activating the software on the 2nd & 3rd machines required a series of very annoying steps that involved logging into their website with broken links . it finally required a phone call . at least , the phone support experience was good . 3. the product promises to minimize performance impact , and improve overall performance . on the lattitude & dimension ( powerful machines ) , there was no difference in performance , but we could notice a slightly slower performance with the x1. this was later verified when we uninstalled the ms windows onecare and replaced it with another product . 4. the product has difficulty updating . it opens a small message box that asks you to click to update onecare , but that takes you to a webpage that only works about 1 in 4 times . 5. except for the first time , data backup always has several errors that i have to manually fix . this has very rarely happened with other data backup software i 've used . 6. some applications , the firewall asks

and elsewhere ) , i decided to purchase one for my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder . when i first opened the box , the vct870rm seemed sturdy and well made . the tilting action was smooth and had a nice touch , and the remote controls on the handle worked well . however , the panning action was so stiff that while attempting to pan , the main column would twist and the handle would bend slightly . it felt like the tension control knob was tightened , but that was not the case . in fact , the panning continued to drag severely even with the tension knob completely removed . i recently found a vct870rm review from about 5 years ago where somebody else was having the same problem with stiff panning . however , due to all of the other great reviews for this tripod , i 'm assuming that i just received a bad one . i 'm now in the process of working with amazon to get a replacement sent to me . so far , amazon has been great , as they 've already scheduled ups to come to my home and pick up the defective tripod the very next day . they say that i 'll receive my new tripod next week . i 'll post here on the status of the new one when it arrives . update : i received a new replacement vct870rm tripod from amazon , and this one works great . panning and tilting are both very smooth , and the tension is adjustable . if i 'd have received this tripod originally , i would 've given it 5 stars .

mandala of cards . this book affords a rich unique perspective of the tarot through the lens of the buddhist paradigm . the companion deck comes in a beautifully illustrated box containing exquisitely designed cards that fit perfectly in my hand , a tiny black gossamer bag plus a bordered little white box with the instructions , \" embellish this box with protective and / or empowering symbols . \" other suggestions that greet you as you begin your journey with the buddha cards include : \" smudge with sage to cleanse and re-energize the cards after a reading . \" and \" store your deck with stones or crystals that absorb negative energy , promote healing , or provide protective energy . \" also included in the box is a mini-book with guidelines on reading these particular cards . both items are published by llewellyn , who as always , have taken great care to ensure quality and aesthetics in the way the cards are packaged and presented . robert has done an amazing job in correlating the life of the buddha with the tarot journey through the cards . he describes how the major arcana fits perfectly with the life of siddhartha and his journey of enlightenment . each of the tarot trumps is a stage on the mystic \\'s journey to enlightenment . in fact , it is mr. place \\'s belief that the creators of the tarot were directly influenced by the life of the buddha , and incorporated archetypes into the major arcana based on his journey . he teaches that the ancient wisdoms were not isolated from one another . instead , \" the classical world maintained communications with india and the ancient western philosophers were familar with indian philosophies . \" as well , the islamic world introduced the christians to the life of the buddha during the middle ages . \" the european christians were enamored with the story , and they transformed him into a christian saint - st. josaphat . \" i was fascinated by the titles given to the major arcana cards . each of the 23 cards reflect an important aspect of the siddhartha \\'s personal journey to become the enlightened one , the buddha . robert place has created a deck and book that not only meets the needs of people who practice eastern beliefs . he also acts as a mediator to help people of the western world learn about and appreciate the noble tenets of buddhism and its teachings for life . i highly recommend this deck - i found it very easy to follow , the graphics are amazingly detailed and artistically rendered and the companion book clearly helps you to learn to \" read \" using a buddhist world view . \\r\\n', \" terrible direction , terrible writing , it almost feels like the director did n't know what he was working with . although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality

presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology . however , he began to venture into misapplication of this method , and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool-proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity , concept , or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement . there are serious logical , philosophical , and practical flaws in his work , and his attempt to quantify matters that are n't quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias & beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests . this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques . the actual technique is worthwhile , but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid . the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate , valid answers . hawkins explores issues about media , politics , religion , spirituality , history , philosophies , healing arts , entertainment , and more , and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters . he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters , liars , and two-faced sociopaths . he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists , many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and do n't resort to hawkins ' misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth . hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method , as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology , but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod . i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts...consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful , responsible work in those areas . for now i 'd encourage hawkins to recognize that 911 was in part an inside job , many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds , and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world \\r\\n\", \" i read an interview with mr. vollman , i think a couple years ago , i ca n't quote directly but he said he thought that prostitutes were very spiritual people . they save marriages , they provide comfort to the loneliest , most desperate among us . in practically the same breath he observed that they spread disease and sometimes rob their johns . that kind of duality is at the heart of much of vollman 's writing . on the surface , whores for gloria is one desperate , delusional man , so eager for even the illusion of relatedness that he attempts to recreate gloria with bits and pieces of other prostitutes . it is n't fully clear if gloria herself was ever real , but regardless , it is now a quest to fill that void collage style with physical samples , such as hair clippings , as well as emotional artifacts . the most poignant scene may be the protagonist hiring a prostitute , and wanting nothing more than to hear happy childhood memories . the prostitute complies as best she can but , story after story , the narratives veer into disturbing material . the hardest thing for the human to do is to hold opposite opinions about one thing at the same time . the more intelligent and observant one is , the more painfully aware of the absurdity of this task , the more painfully aware of the mental contortions necessary to maintain the illusion of meaning . this is where the magic lies in true artistc genius , such as a thelonius monk solo or , in this case , vollman 's writing . i 've never read anything that better communicates simultaneous beauty and ugliness . and no better forum than gutter sex , which vollman renders both repulsive and compelling . and he does n't do it by being overly clever . he does it through the chaos of brute honesty . whatever compositional gymnastics go into the writing , the end product is very readable and deceptively simple \\r\\n\", ' actually i

at the runaway success of the & quot ; left behind&quot ; series , since it demonstrates that a preoccupation with bible prophecy affects a much wider demographic than the fundamentalist subculture . indeed , the impact of premillenial thought has extended all the way up to the reagan white house . and , christian or not , who has n't heard of the term & quot ; antichrist&quot ; or the significance of the number & quot ; 666&quot ; ? this book presents a fairly comprehensive survey of popular eschatology , including the role of israel , russia , the arab countries , europe , and the united states . it also shows how those beliefs have changed over the years ( turkey was considered gog and magog before russia was , and the pope was designated as the antichrist for years before hitler and henry kissinger came along ) . the final chapter , written at the brink of the collapse of the soviet union , demonstrates how , once again , premillenial thought adjusts itself ( or sometimes not ) depending upon world conditions . this is a fair , even-handed treatment of a religious and cultural phenomenon \\r\\n\", \" this lens does exactly what it should . the overall quality is extremely good . take a look at my photos : - first photo is without the lens - second photo is with the lens and flash - third photo is with the lens and without flash there are a few things to note about the photos : - there is a substantial amount of barrel distortion . this is normal . try not to have straight lines near the borders of the photo to make it less obvious . - fringing is exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) along high contrast edges of objects that are near the borders . you can see this on regular shots but is more exaggerated with the wide angle lens . - the lens makes a shadow when using the built-in flash . you can see the shadow in the photo with the flash . in a darker environment , it is very obvious . the external flash is the only way to fix this . a couple details : - you can get an extender that is a nice brushed aluminum here : http : / / www.lensmateonline.com / s2.html - the camera has a setting ( converter ) to indicate that you have the lens attached . it 's not obvious what it does but it is indicated by a change in the image stabilization icon so i assume that it affects the way that image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens \\r\\n\", \" i use this film just normally for everyday stuff . it is n't grainy when you enlarge the photos , and the colors are just outstanding . i use the

cat kane was a powerful , intense and moving story about two delightful yet flawed characters who had secrets that tore their relationship up until they were able to work their ways ( separately ) around the issues . that story deserved a five stars plus rating and i wish kane would turn it into a full length novel and develop the characters and their backgrounds more . this book is an

ship to ship missile in the exocet . very unlikely that the french would use an american made harpoon . later in the novel , hawke is taking off from a carrier deck in the latest vtol aircraft , the f-35. the catapult fails and hawke is put in grave danger . my problem , this is a vtol aircraft , which the author goes to great lengths to mention and describe . why would there be a \" cat shot \" at all . vtols are designed for vertical takeoff and then transistion into level flight , which , again the author describes . also this scene has nothing to do with the story . just another \" saturday cliff hanger \" episode . this is my second attempt at a ted bell novel , assasin being the first . there are too many other writers out there than give a sense of believability for me to

masterfully executed . one example of this technique was when peter tries to get to grips with his emotions concerning the possible loss of his brother frankie before frankie goes into surgery . a joy to read . da is the sun and all the minor planets revolve around him . peter takes to his role as mercury the messenger with great relish . there is a strong bond between father and son . i feel this

bit put off by the new ribbons which replace the old menus . i guess that office needed a new look , but i am not sure if i buy the advertising that the ribbon will make my work more productive . some things that you should know about office 2007 and ultimate in general . the licensing agreement allows you to install office 2007 ultimate on two computers , one of them being a laptop . i found this clause in the legal agreement and even called microsoft legal to confirm . if you make modifications to the quick access toolbar ( and who wo n't do that ? ) and you want to take these changes with you to another computer , the files for the toolbars are located at : c: \\\\documents and settings\\\\username\\\\local settings\\\\application data\\\\microsoft\\\\office where username is your username . something i have found handy when working with my two computers . one thing that i do n't like is that the file name extensions have changed . gone is the familiar .doc for word documents . now the file extension is .docx . if you want to create a document that can still be opened by prior versions of word , you must purposefully choose to create a .doc file , but you lose some of the functionality of the new files . the .docx file this format is not the same as the opendocument standard . microsoft promises that older versions of word can still open the .docx files , but i have not tried it and i do n't buy into everything that microsoft promises until i see it happen . why could n't microsoft just leave the files the same as they have always been ? office 2007 does look slick and i anticipate that i will warm up to it in the future as i get used to the new command structure . \\r\\n\", ' the camera came with no memory chip . the online store had no more of this

my new 30d , but it looks like i do n't want to risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start by saying that the only reason i gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because it did prevent my nose from smudging the lcd screen . i shoot events at nightclubs a lot , so i 'm always ( a ) running around to get shots , causing me to sweat , which causes a sweaty and oily nose tip and ( b ) i always show the subjects their photos after i take them , so having a smudgy screen can be kind of annoying . for further clarification , i 'm asian , so my nose is not as defined or long as other ethnicities . i run around a lot when i shoot . so the constant activity eventually led the extender to naturally fall off . i got lucky once , and found it in the general vicinity of where i was , but the second time , i was n't so lucky . so what did i do ? i purchased another one . not only did i have to purchase the extender , i had to purchase the viewfinder replacement ( the piece with the soft rubber ) because that was attached to the lost extender . another 2 weeks in , and again , same problem . i did n't even bother buying any replacements , as by this time , i upgraded to the 30d . if you do n't plan on doing a lot of running around , then this piece may be okay for you . however , please take into consideration that this piece also fell off for me while putting my camera back in my canon backpack . for some reason , the piece did n't fit tightly with the mount on the camera . another problem , as most people mentioned , is that images are very noticeably smaller through this extender , so be prepared to have strained eyes if you plan on using your camera all day . i guess i 'll check it out at my local camera shop and see how it fits with the 30d ; i 'll be sure to write another review if the results are different than with the 10d \\r\\n\", \" my arms used to get so sore because i 'd blow-dry my thick , frizzy , curly hair for about 1 1 / 2 hours and then have

i \\'m well on the road to recovery myself by applying the principles in her book . now that \\'s a book well worth spending your money on \\r\\n', ' so , yeah , it mounts in your bathroom with the suction cups , and once it \\'s mounted , it stays put pretty well . unfortunately , it has so far never actually been \" fogless . \" get a good shower going , and the mirror fogs up in record time . splash some water on it , and you can see yourself for half a minute , but overall , this is a disappointment . \\r\\n', ' i really did n\\'t enjoy the movie , but i had to finish it . the hypocrisy of faith and her sidekicks mirrored so many of the so-called fundamentalist that i know , but the ignorance and hopelessness of the others were terrifying . this movie presented a very perverted view of christianity . though there was alot of talking about jesus and saying his name , it was clear that no one in the entire movie actually knew him and spent time with him . when mary gets a revelation from something she believes is christ that opposed the actual word of god , she finds someone who is crazier than the average nut to confirm her decision . christ does not tell anyone to do things that goes against his word . no one actually reads a bible in the movie . consequently , most made many life-damaging decisions . i hated the \" reality \" of the movie , but it has challenged me to actually spend time with christ and learn about him . i shudder to think that i could live long enough to present such a twisted veiw of what christianity truly is . \\r\\n', \" yo nu-mixx sux i hate when people make cd 's like this to make some money off of great artist like pac . this cd is disrespecting pac and nobody should get this if your a pac fan . they take great songs and make crappy beats . get this if you want to support pac haters or waste your money \\r\\n\", \" this is kl 's reveiw this was a very good movie but the plot was a little on the strange side . mitchel musso did a great job , well we all know he always does a great job.okay i 'll stop drooling over him and get back to the movie . this movie is about a cranky old man that dos n't like people to set one foot on his lawn , and a teenage boy that lives across the street that documents every toy the old man takes because it touched his lawn , what time it was when it accured , and takes pictures.but then when a tragic incident happens to the old man and every one asumes him dead well at least the boys do . the teenager dj and his friend chouder discover that the house is even stranger than the old man and that the house seems to be possessed by the old man , well thats what the boys think . then when a arogant girl named jenny selling holloween candy goes up to the house dj and chouder come to her rescue and she ends up helping them find out more about the house . their plan is to put out the fire or the heart of the house . but when thay finally get inside of the house they discover a very strange thing which i 'm not going to say because your going to have to just watch it for your self.but before they get to the heart , they get up chucked , lol.and then a horrable thing comes to their minds its holloween and every kid that goes to that house is going to get eaten ! but i 'm geting too close to the ending or am i ? well if you have n't seen it you would n't know so you 'll just have to watch it because i 'm not giving any more of the movie away ! hope you like it and by the way mitchel musso 's mine !

you 'll love it \\r\\n\", \" this is a well made head constructed of solid metal with a nice finish . there are no plastic parts and even the rubber piece on the quick release plate is hard rubber . i have used it every week for about two years and have had no problems with it . i use it mainly attached to a monopod for sports photography and videography . the quick release has a clever locking mechanism to prevent accidental release . i bought an extra quick release plate so i can switch between two cameras . tilt only - - no swivel : amazon ( and others including bogen ) calls it a swivel tilt head , but that seems to imply that it moves in two directions - - tilting ( up and down ) and swivelling ( side to side or panning ) . this head only moves in the tilting direction which allows you to orient the camera in either landscape or portrait modes . the tilting action could be improved if the head clicked into the upright position when you tilt it back to landscape . when you are going to the portrait mode , there 's no problem since it stops at 90 degrees . however , when i want to go back to landscape , i have to hold it out and look at it to see if it 's level . a subtle click to know i 'm there would be nice \\r\\n\", \" do n't buy zone alarm if you use aol ; they are not compatable . the pop-ups will drive you crazy and aol wo n't work properly . also plan on your computer running much slower when this software is installed . i bought it from amazon and had to throw it away in a month.. . no refund ; money lost . norton is far better with aol \\r\\n\", \" i wanted to buy a compact slim d-camera . those with larger zoom are quite bulky , you ca n't carry around all the time . i think a slim camera is a better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around and come across something nice and take a picture of it . you ca n't do it with a huge camera . after i made up mind about a slim camera , my choices were either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims are very sexy . they have a lot of mode scenes . they also function as voice recorder . you can take pictures of book pages etc. they have anti-shake capability which is said to reduce blurred images . i was almost buying a casio exilim . being a diligent person i wanted to search more and more . i found out that the so-called anti-shake feature is a bogus . many people found it useless . that was a good reason to choose casio . then i found the picture quality of exilim is not really good.i found some pictures taken with exilim . they were soft , not crisp colors . search the web reviews made by photo professionals . casio exilim is rated significantly less than sony in picture quality . with iso 200 noise was still detectable in most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing a better job . there was no noise with iso 400 which means even in lower light condition sony did a better job ( less granularity in pictures with low light ) . big difference ! . one feature of sony that made it very attractive was its strong macro . it is 0.74 inch which means you can bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close to an object ( say a bug ) and still take a brilliant picture of it . now comparison of exilim and sony to summarize : casio exilim anti-shake ( it 's a bogus ) slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches ) lower picture quality ( detectable noise at iso 200 ) a lot of scene modes quick shutter sony dscw series slim ( in fact it is slimmer ) higher macro ( 0.74 inches ) higher picture quality ( no noise in iso 400 ) not a lot of scene modes quick shutter so.....i purchased a sony dscw 7 mp. i took lots of pictures . they are all brilliant , detailed and crisp , true colors . i tried macro and took pictures of bugs . you can see the hairs on the legs of bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it 's a marvel of technology . i took pictures of fireworks in july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses a different kind of battery that you ca n't buy at your grocery which can leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy a spare one ( about 40 bucks ) . but you can always recharge it . and it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it was a perfect choice . i highly recommend it . \\r\\n\", ' i personally have not taken this diet pill ; however i am compelled to note the descriptions from folks stating that they felt \" trippy \" \" weird \" and \" out of sorts \" . britney spears had been taking this stuff for a while...then as we all know she went all \" postal \" , shaved her head , attacked photographers and just all around went out in left field and did n\\'t return.....and we wonder why she did it...hummmm.. . none the less , the side effects like those reported i \\'ve seen personally from close friends . they should re-name this diet pill asylum-x , because that \\'s where you \\'ll be . diet pills like these have a negative effect on the seratonin in your spinal fluids , and i do n\\'t know about you but i \\'m not comfortable with something altering my state of being....just something for you to \" swallow \" \\r\\n', \" either you get on the train or you don't ... and as long as you continue to get on the train , you 'll grasp the meaning of christmas . the true meaning of christmas . but you have to be willing to get on . this movie was a great adaptation of the classic story . i must admit i was a tad bit wigged out by the animation . it was just oogey in some ways . realistic at times and , at other times , so unbelievably fake.. . i could n't decide if i liked the animation or not . still can't . but the story itself is worth the struggle i had with the animation . get on board !

it does n\\'t pull them all the way out , which is even worse because it means you have to go over and over the same spots if your desperate enough to continue . sometimes it works okay , but what good is a razor that only works half the time ? others here have noted the short battery life and change in sound when it \\'s losing power . mine does sound \" slower \" when it \\'s yanking the hair , but that does n\\'t seem to be related to battery charge ( e.g. it can start the shave in evil hair-pulling mode , and then straighten up and shave right five minutes in !

begins to turn problematic by not having an edge . and morissette should never have brought john shanks or tim thorney ( or both ) on board for assistance because she was left with bland arrangements behind many of the tracks . \" doth i protest too much \" is without a doubt the worst song alanis has ever recorded . the title song attempts for a gritty and gutsy feel but even that attempt becomes

last year \\'s model of this braun , a triple blade rotary from the leading manufacturer of rotary razors and standard double edged disposables from the major manufacturer of razors . ok , now , let \\'s do some math . i get 10 great shaves from a disposable razor . i pay , on average , 40c or so for a disposable razor . that is about a nickel a shave including the shave cream . at a nickel a shave , it would take 3000 shaves before i would spend $150. would take me over 8 years . now , anyone that says any electric razor shaves better than a double edged high quality blade razor ( not even the expensive triple edged ones , just cheap disposables ) is dreaming . the blace does a much better job and much faster . but , sometimes , they can irritate the skin , but electrics can too . i can get irritated by both , sooooo , i rotate between them , and find that reduces my skin irritation problem quite well . i bought this braun ( last year \\'s model ) after reading the positive reviews here , and later bought a rotary razor . the basic difference is that the cheap model rotary from that major manufacturer is much quieter , shaves just as well , and cost me about 1 / 3 the price . the only thing that is better in the braun is the battery lasts longer . it is possible also , that in some cases , it gives a slightly closer shave than the rotary , but it also tends to miss spots no matter how many times i go over them . the braun also has a problem with my beard when it is longer , like when i have two to three days growth . the rotary and disposable razor breeze through that three day bush . the cleaning machine / charger that comes with the braun is a joke . yes , it cleans the razor great , but it is way oversized and you need a large space for it in your bathroom . even then , say you have that larger space , you can pay between $5.00 and $8.00 each for the cleaning cartridges . i have found they last about a month before drying out . add $60 to your annual cost to just clean your razor . the rotary cleans fine with a brush and the disposable razors with water . finally , the switch that turns on the razor is right where you hold the razor and it also locks the blade . so i am constantly locking the blade position by accident . inexcusable design flaw in a razor this price . do n\\'t get me wrong . this razor shaves fine . it works best on short beards and works better than cheap razors . but for $50 you can get a better rotary razor and for $150 you can shave for over 8 years with a disposable twin blade . does the price difference

ritchie valens , was released . the film cast lou diamond phillips as the classic musician , and told his story , from his rise to fame , right down to his young and tragic death . for the film , los lobos , a fairly popular act of the day , was asked to rerecord classic valens material for the movie . some other moderately popular musicians who portrayed other musicians of the same era depicted in the film also provided recordings for the film . so , how is the soundtrack ? read on , and find out ! overview : the la bamba soundtrack was released in 1987 , around the same time as the film of the same name . contributors to the soundtrack include los lobos , howard huntsberry , marshall crenshaw , brian setzer , and bo diddley . the a-side of the soundtrack sonsists of the los lobos covers of the ritchie valens songs la bamba , come on lets go , ooh my head , we belong together , framed , and donna . the b-side consists of the other artists ' covers , which include howard huntsberry 's cover of jackie wilson 's lonely teardrops , marshall crenshaw 's cover of buddy holly 's crying waiting hoping , brian setzer 's cover of eddie cochran 's summertime blues , bo diddley 's remake of his own classic tune who do you love , and the two songs los lobos recorded for the film which were not remakes , charlena and goodnight my love . review : awesome movie , awesome soundtrack . i 'm a huge fan of the music of ritchie valens , and for the most part , la bamba proved to be an efficient and entertaining retelling of the valens saga . aside from some omitted material ( which i 'll get to later ) , the soundtrack is every bit as good as the film it represents . read on for my reviews of the tracks . -side a - -la bamba by los lobos : los lobos covers the track that took ritchie valens to the top of the musical world . being a folk song , no one ever thought a rock and roll version would do well - valens proved the non-believers wrong ! los lobos does a great cover of it , too . the band actually did two versions of the song for the movie - a rendition of the slower , folksier version by the bar band that convinced valens to cover the song himself , as well as the classic version valens did . this is the classic valens version . i wish they had included both versions of the soundtrack , though ( although an instrumental sequence near the end of this version does reprise elements of the folk-type version . still , i wanted both versions as complete , separate tracks ! ) -come on lets go by los lobos : this classic rockabilly-style cut was another huge hit for ritchie valens . los lobos creates a fine rendition of the classic cut , staying true to the valens original while at the same time adding their own spin onto things . all in all , another great song . -ooh my head by los lobos : not much to say about this one . once again , los lobos manages to create an excellent version of one of the many classic valens tunes people know and love him for . every song on this soundtrack is excellent , and this one is no exception . -we belong together by los lobos : ah , the classic valens love song . although its success was pretty much ousted by the better known ballad donna , this one was still a fairly notable hit for valens . the los lobos take on the ballad is a damn good one - but i should n't have to tell you that , now should i ? -framed by los lobos : of all of the ritchie valens song that los lobos revisited in la bamba , this one is the least well known . that 's a shame , because it 's a great song ! the song takes a classic blues styling , and puts a rockabilly spin on it . once again , los lobos does a marvelous cover version of the song . -donna by los lobos : this song was so big a hit for ritchie valens initially , that his only song even on the same plane of popularity is la bamba . the classic ode valens wrote to his high school girlfriend proved to be the stuff that has withstood the test of time . and i know you 're probably getting tired of me saying this for every song , but los lobos really does a good job on here . -side b - -lonely teardrops by howard huntsberry : in la bamba , howard huntsberry portrayed the classic soul singer jackie wilson . and here , huntsberry reprises wilson 's signature tune . this is classic soul at its very best . prior to seeing la bamba , i had never even heard of huntsberry . but the real shocker is that i ended up liking this version of the song more than the original ! definitely a solid , underrated cut . -crying waiting hoping by marshall crenshaw : marshall crenshaw , a fairly popular eighties pop signer , managed to land the role of buddy holly in la bamba . holly , of course , was killed in the same plane crash that claimed the life of ritchie valens . buddy holly is a tough guy to cover , but marshall crenshaw does a damn good job of it . i personally prefer this version over holly 's original ( and that 's saying a lot since i love buddy holly ! ) if you 're interested in hearing crenshaw cover another holly tune , check out the remastered version of his 1982 self-titled debut - he covers rave on on there as a bonus track . -summertime blues by brian setzer : long before brian setzer gained any real fame , he played eddie cochran in la bamba , covering the song that made that man a rockabilly legend . here 's another one of those covers that is so good , i like it more than the original . definitely worthwhile listening - but then again , is n't every song on here ? -who do you love by bo diddley : bo diddley himself did this song originally so very long ago , and was asked to rerecord it for la bamba . he did , and the end results are solid . diddley is a legend of the blues , and this recording is just a small sample of why so many people feel that way . it just a shame that the version of this song most people remember is the george thorogood one , because diddley 's version is the song the way it was meant to be heard . -charlena by los lobos : in addition to the ritchie valens covers , los lobos recorded two new songs for the la bamba soundtrack . this is the first of the two . essentially , this here is a neo-rockabilly track of sorts , and a damn good one too . long after the fifties music scene died out , los lobos still managed to record a song that suited the style perfectly . -goodnight my love by los lobos : here 's the second of the newly-recorded los lobos songs done for the soundtrack . what we have here is one of those classic fifties-style rock ballads that were so popular back then . if you 're into that sort of thing , you 're going to love this song - i know i do ! -other comments - omissions are the biggest problem with this soundtrack , by far . as i previously stated , only one version of la bamba is on here - not both versions from the film . another omission is sleepwalk , the classic santo and johnny instrumental that shows up frequently in the film . its omission is likely due to the fact that it was n't recorded just for the film , but still , i miss it . and then there 's the issue of rip it up , the classic ritchie valens rockabilly tune he first plays with his band in their garage , early on in the film . this was one of my favorite songs in the film , and i was devastated not to see it on here . and where 's the big bopper 's chantilly lace ? i rated this soundtrack four stars instead of five because of omissions . if these songs had been on here , it would be five stars all the way . overall : overall , despite my issues with the omitted songs , i am very satisfied with the la bamba soundtrack . much like the movie , it 's an excellent experience all the way through . if you liked the movie , or you 're just into this sort of music , the soundtrack is well worth owning . highly recommended ! edition notes : this soundtrack is becoming increasingly more difficult to find on compact disc , implying it may be very gradually going out of print . take my advice - if you want it , just buy it online . it 's the fastest , easiest way to get it . \\r\\n\", \" i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel . one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d . macdonald style just because that 's what film-going audiences like . i do not think this is a bad thing , but i , like some of the reviewers here , are so fed up with clich\\x1a plots that just borrow from i.e. , macdonald 's & quot ; cape fear , & quot ; or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof . as for her writing style , she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown . what we 're left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents , davy , his fiancee , and to some extent , lani , who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman . her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone-challenged . the men in this novel just were n't credible when they spoke . i kept seeing jance speaking for them . so we 're left with a high-concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker . what 's the

jeff bridges , who brings a layered sadness to many of his roles , i simply could not connect and did not care about these people . it was this huge budget american movie shorthand : we \\'re supposed to care because we \\'ve been given a snippit of a scene that reminds us of something else , but it just does n\\'t work for me . if i do n\\'t care this far into the movie , it just wo n\\'t happen . visually beautiful , and sky high production values on costumes and sets , it is wasted in these disjointed storytelling . whoever cast the extras has wonderful faces , which the cinematographer and editor took full advantage of , but why do n\\'t we get faces like that in the major characters . of course chris cooper has that kind of face , but many others ( esp . all the \" size 2 women \" in the supporting roles ) seem to have stepped out of a commercial . the chicago tribune called this film \" sleek and beautiful . \" i will completely agree with that , but so are music videos . i kept asking myself , what is wrong , what is misfiring ? i really wanted to like it . some of it is the short-hand story telling , but the look was almost too pretty . when the cinematography is this gorgeous , you want and need to linger on something smaller and deeper , or really take all the time you need to connect with something bigger -a mini-series . ultimately , i began wondering if the original length was much longer , and it was cut down so much that it became fractured , and if that is the case , my apologies to the director . this is the kind of film that makes me ponder , what is it that european film-makers \" get \" that we lose in our big budget studio films ? is the system itself hurting some films , by sanitizing and conforming them , when they need to stick out like an unruly horse \\'s nose at the starting gate ? very beautiful , but no connection , and not satisfying.. . well , that \\'s a lot of things in hollywood in a nutshell , is n\\'t it ? there are lots of special features on this dvd , but if i ca n\\'t sit through the film , i do n\\'t care about the extras . so glad i borrowed this instead of buying it ! i hear the book is something wonderful.. .

lie than the mundane truth . though i do n\\'t agree with most of what \\'s written in this book , i do n\\'t regret buying it . it teaches me how to con ignorant people with high tech jargon and conspiracy theories . if people believe that amalgams or metal restorations are the cause of their headaches , fatigue or whatever symptoms , then removing them will definitely cure them . that \\'s how faith healing works . the only reason why i do n\\'t use amalgam in my practice is because i do cosmetic dentistry . if the patient does not mind the colour , amalgam is definitely a superior direct filling material for class 2 and subgingival preps . i have absolutely no qualms about having that done for myself . toxicity ? sure , some people are affected by amalgams and anything can be toxic to somebody , but let \\'s not forget that these cases are extremely rare ( perhaps less than 10 on this planet and most of them would be chinese ) . there are literally thousands of tests and studies establishing amalgams as safe filling materials over the last 100 years . there are numerous studies that show how safe amalgams are . if dr breiner has been to asia where we have much healthier diets and lifestyles , he may notice that we also have many healthy 70 to 90-year-old asian men and women who have gold and amalgam-filled teeth in their mouths . are composites totally safe ? the incidence of allergic reactions to composites ( very low ) is higher than that of amalgam toxicity . this is something the author failed to inform us . all his anecdotal evidence are almost laughable as they are not supported by independent studies and sceptical parties . not one case he mentioned can be conclusively attributed to amalgam . mercury can be very toxic , but after tituration and amalgamation , the metal remains in the solid state and is not absorbed by the body . it \\'s different from inhaling mercury vapour daily , injecting or ingesting mercury or mercuric compounds . at the end of the day , propagating such beliefs will only spark panic , paranoia and various psychosomatic \" illnesses \" . following breiner \\'s protocols for \" detox \" , patients will only be paying a fortune for otherwise very simple dental work . gosh , with so many gullible patients in america , i should probably move my practice to america and start doing amalgam detox

cecilia , the youngest , lives in her sisters shadows because they are all older and of much more interest to their male neighbors . as a cry for help , she slits her wrists and lays down in the bathtub , she survived the incident . after a psychiatrist highly impresses upon the strict mr. and mrs. lisbon that it would be benificial for cecilia to be exposed to environments which have boys her own age , mr. and mrs. lisbon decide to allow the girls to throw the one and only lisbon party . some of the neighborhood \\'s boys are invited over and while the party is in session , cecilia is pretty inanimate , sitting on the couch while her sisters flirt , talk and laugh . midway through the party , cecilia asks to be excused and mrs. lisbon - though somewhat reluctantly - allows it . cecilia goes up to her room ( on the second floor of a two-story house ) and jumps out the window , landing on the spiked fence on the front lawn of the lisbon house . in this way , cecilia lisbon commited suicide . only four girls remain . the act which cecilia committed did not go at all unnoticed . the father saw her immediately , the party ended there and all of the boys went home rather glum . four of the lisbon \\'s neighbors , four young boys , suffered a rapidly growing obsession with the lisbon girls , who were beautiful and a total mystery to the outside world . they got hold of cecilia \\'s diary and tried to explain why she committed suicide . the eldest decided cecilia was a dreamer , and she did not think she would fall when she jumped out her window , she thought she would fly . with their youngest sister gone , the remaining lisbon girls grow closer to each other , stranding themselves further from the outside world . when school starts again , they attempt to go on acting as if nothing happened , not ever mentioning their youngest sister . the run-of-the-mill awkward act is taken part by the rest of the school however . the usual profuse apology to the mention of the word \" death \" and the like . trip fontaine is the most popular guy in school , the object of desire to all of the girls at school.. . except for the lisbon girls , which is of no importance to trip until he sets eyes on lux . trip cannot help but be enchanted by her flawless beauty . in the beginning , he is unsuccessful in his quest to even catch her attention for she bluntly shows she \\'s not interested . but after his consistent courtship , lux falls for his charming ways . trip then attempts to convince mr. lisbon to let him and three of his football team pals take the lisbon daughters to homecoming . after mr. lisbon talks to his wife , he agrees to trip \\'s request , knowing nothing but trip \\'s sincerity and claimed honorable intentions , on the understanding that trip have all of the lisbon girls returned to the house by curfew . after trip explains the situation to his football peers , he gives in to those who bribe him the most handsomely . meanwhile , the lisbon girls are picking out fabric for the dresses they shall wear to the homecoming dance . though one pattern is used for all four dresses , each dress looks unique when concentrating on detail . once they pick up the girls , they stop midway to the homecoming in order to smoke , lux being the only girl volunteering to smoke . they then drive to the dance . trip and lux sneak away and sneak swallows of alcohol . another one of the lisbon sisters and her date follow , but leave soon afterwards , not being as wild nor daring as trip and lux . at the time they all decided to meet back at the car so they could make the girls curfew , they are all there.. . except for trip and lux , who at that time were alone in the middle of the football stadium field . deciding they must make their own curfews , therese , bonnie , mary and their dates leave without them . after fooling around , the intoxicated trip and lux fall asleep in the middle of the football stadium . trip awakens in the middle of the night and leaves lux there alone . when lux wakes up early the next morning she is confused as to why trip is not there . she takes a taxi home and her parents were worried sick ( of course ) . but they take measures as far as pulling the girls out of school and stranding them inside the lisbon residence . the girls , in a desperate attempt to hold onto a connection to the outside world , begin using morse code to interact with the four boys who so closely follow their lives . one of which boys lived across the street and the rest which came over daily after this in order to contact the girls . soon following , the boys begin talking to the lisbon girls via phone . one day , the girls invite the boys to come over once mr. and mrs. lisbon are asleep . the plan being that the boys were to drive the girls somewhere , the boys hastily agree . they sneak over and lux invites them to wait inside for her sisters and lux goes to wait in the car . the boys wander down to the basement while waiting for therese , bonnie and mary , verbally expressing their hopes for the night . but then they realize they have stumbled upon one of the sisters . she had hung herself . the boys , scared to death , run all the way home . time passed , things changed , girls came and went.. . but no matter what , those four boys never forgot the lisbon suicides . ultimately , the movie was nothing short of queer . when trying to sum up the story in a few lines ( such as \" follow the lives of the lisbon sisters and how they connect to their neighbors . a story full of obsession , gossip , lust , love , desire and isolation . \" ) the story sounds quite unique and intriguing , but the story fell short of that for me personally . partly because the lisbon sisters really committed suicide for a reason not much deeper than isolation . the movie , in places , is also extremely flawed . i do not believe mr. and mrs. lisbon could \\'ve removed their daughters from school for so long without their daughters being taken from them by social services . in many parts of the movie , they should \\'ve used upbeat music to fill the deafening silences . the whole movie was filmed in a style that i can truthfully say makes me rather bored . i would only suggest this film to , perhaps , people who like movies such as \" elizabethtown \" which kirsten dunst is also in .

got the idea he was an artist ? not to put too fine an edge on it , let 's say bluntly that this is a vanity project by a middling talent . falkner does everything on the cd and my reaction is so what ? his voice is mediocre ; his lyrics are banal ( & quot ; life can be just like a painting full of wonderful strangeness&quot ; ) or precious ( & quot ; suspended on this stage of grace i have to remember this sound&quot ; ) ; the layers of sound he tracks down are just that - - layers of sound , with a disspiriting sameness song after song . give him two stars simply because he can do all the

quicken willmaker plus software . instead , it concerns the actions of an insurance agent who was found to have practiced law without a license . he used will-making software ( not quicken willmaker plus ) to write a will for an elderly client . the trouble arose because he created the will outside of her presence and arranged for her to sign it while she was hospitalized . apparently she never reviewed the will . in other words , he acted too much like a lawyer . while the \" unauthorized practice of law \" is a vague concept , had the insurance agent merely recorded the woman \\'s wishes and entered them verbatim into the software , there would almost certainly have been no problem . there is no problem with using software to prepare a will for your self . nor is there a problem with using it to create a will for someone else if you merely type in that person \\'s answers at their direction . the main way to run afoul of unauthorized-practice-of-law rules is to give legal advice to or prepare documents for others without their express , detailed instructions . \\r\\n', \" i bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys , who

one-star rating not because it is a poor product , rather , because it is so expensive . the dosage is 81 mg , taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes ( generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis , have had a heart attack or stroke ) . aspirin is a wonder-drug , the very first analgesic / anti-inflammatory medication to hit the market over 100 years ago . it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis , bone inflammation , joint pain , and even reduces fever . aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other , thus it \" thins \" the blood and prevents blood clots from forming . aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes . some folks take a \" baby \" aspirin ( 81-160 mgs ) each day to prevent blood clots from forming . aspirin is actually acetyl-salicylic acid . manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion , to make digestion easier . some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach ( like ecotrin ) . regular aspirin , without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people , but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset . for these folks , the buffered form is a god-send . unfortunately , aspirin fell out of favor in the 60 \\'s and 70 \\'s when reye \\'s syndrome developed in some children ( under the age of 16 ) who took aspirin while they had the flu and / or chickenpox . about 30% of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage . because of reye \\'s syndrome , alternate analgesics were placed on the market , the premier being tylenol . there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult , as reye \\'s syndrome only occurred in children under 16 years of age . the usual dose of aspirin is 350 mg , with the \" extra-strength form at 500 mg . most adults will easily tolerate a dose of 650 mg ( 2 tablets ) every 4 hours with a maximum daily dose of 5 , 200 mg . ( some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to 7200 mg / day with a doctor \\'s supervision ) . there is no additional benefit to taking more than 1 , 000 mg every 4 hours . increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin . aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood-thinning medications , those with stomach ulcers , and used with caution in insulin-dependent diabetics . allergies can develop to aspirin as well . never mix aspirin with any of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatories , such as ibuprofen , as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased . do n\\'t mix aspirin with alcohol either , as it is hard on the stomach . used properly , aspirin is a terrific medication . i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form . one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name-brand manufacturer . however , the big-manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better . jim \" konedog \" koenig \\r\\n', ' this is an excellent product for kids . my kid loves to learn with this software . i had issues installing this product . other than installation issues , it has been excellent . we are having fun now !

! as for me , i made it about thirty minutes into the film before turning it off in dismay . the fault in order of importance : poor screenplay , poor cinematography and poor performance by pacino , who seems to be vying for the most over-the-top performance . the film was absurd in many ways from the outset : the pans from star to star lasting just short of giving the viewer any purpose for any of the fast camera pans . close-up after close-up conveying no meaning , pacino overacting like jack palance in one of his not-so-famous european pieces of tripe from the sixties and seventies , an utterly dumb plot with pacino and company proving at the beginning that they are bumbling cops . first example , they chase the bad guy to a cabin which is on stilts or something like that ; then , instead of staying on the ground below and smoking the bad guy out or something at least tactically sound , they storm the stairs and pacino stands right in front of the door yelling \" police , you \\'re under arrest . \" they kick in the front door and find that the culprit has escaped through an underground water source . of course , pacino follows and dives right into the underwater stream , having absolutely no idea where the guy is or if there are boobytraps of some sort . cut to pacino running around in nearly zero visibility fog , glimpsing the guy for a second or two before losing him in the fog . stumbling around further , pacino is obviously disoriented until a shot is fired at him from , we must assume , his quarry . did the screen writer forget that pacino \\'s colleagues are also supposedly chasing the culprit , too ? inevitably and apparently not , because pacino spots a figure in the fog and plugs him . as i watched this scene unfold , i became thoroughly disheartened when it becomes clear what i knew already , that pacino has fired on and killed his partner . it was then that i decided that i had had enough . by the way , the european version , with stellan skarsgaard is infinitely superior . do n\\'t waste your money or on-line rental queue on this hollywood drivel . ditto for the other pacino junk i rented at the same time , the recruit , which i could only stand for about a half hour too \\r\\n', \" i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid 's indoor soccer games . the light was low , but not that low . you should be able to take a picture without the flash . when i took the flash off , the picture looked fine on the preview , but came out completely black . yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level !

but nothing comes of this . in fact the whole restaurant subplot just peters out , with no resolution . when the movie ended my first thought was \" what , that \\'s it ? it \\'s over ? \" . people might say \" well , life has loose ends \" but this is a movie , not life . it should have an ending . i know i \\'m definitely in the minority concerning volver . my wife thinks i \\'m nuts for not liking this film but i really think the emperor has no clothes here \\r\\n', ' my 11 year old daughter loves playing this game . graphics could be better but overall it teaches them a lot about horses

crusade of tracking down nudie pics of her daughter on the internet . she \\'s denounced such websites \\' \" exploitation \" on national tv , and has even developed a side business as a cybercop , lending her web-busting skills to other stars . milano \\'s mother / manager could have saved herself the trouble had she instead steered her daughter away from doing this film . embrace of the vampire is softcore horror porn , and the source for many of those milano skin pics . after tv \\'s who \\'s the boss was canceled ( but before charmed returned milano to star status ) milano was just another unemployed former child actress , so maybe this porn film seemed like a good career move at the time . milano has stated in interviews that she wanted to demonstrate that she was not the goody-two-shoes girl she \\'d played in who \\'s the boss . in other words , she wanted to \" grow \" as an actress . so she did embrace of the vampire , in which she goes topless in several scenes , engages in a lesbian romp with charlotte lewis , and participates in orgies with characters tonguing various parts of her nude body . mission accomplished . actually , embrace of the vampire uses milano \\'s virginal image from who \\'s the boss by casting her as ... a virgin . a virgin whose boobs are straining against her too-tight blouse and who undresses before her boyfriend ( albeit asking him not to look ) , but still , a virgin . a virgin who dreams of orgies and fondles lesbians and does n\\'t know why . here \\'s why : milano is the reincarnation of martin kemp \\'s true love . some 300 years ago , a pack of scantily clad vampresses turned kemp into a vampire during a blood orgy . now that he \\'s rediscovered milano , he has three nights to rekindle her love for him . if so , they will live forever as vampires . if not , he dies and loses her forever . why the sudden three-night deadline ? why not . the plot and motivations are paper thin , as is typical of porn . milano wanders around campus , wondering why she \\'s having so many sexual dreams , even daydreams . her boyfriend wanders about , wondering if she \\'s so pure . kemp wanders about , seen by milano but often not by others . lewis wanders about for some bisexual action . other collegiates wander about their parties and campus back alleys for some hetero action . amid all this wandering there \\'s much carnal action , and more carnal dreaming . occasionally , kemp kills someone for dissing milano . john stanley ( in his creature features movie guide ) correctly refers to it as a \" meandering , almost formless script . \" kemp has the best lines . like many vampires , he agonizes and suffers a hyper-romantic vampire angst over a lost love . his appearance is a touch effeminate ( too much eyeliner ) , but it lends an appropriate sinister element to his character . he is part romantic vampire , part bloodthirsty beast . lewis \\'s small part is pointless to the \" story . \" all that \\'s required is that she undress , and when she does , it was worth the wait . rachel true ( the craft ) has an even smaller role , the fate of all the characters who keep their clothes on . all of the above three are more interesting , more charismatic , than milano or her boyfriend . at film \\'s end , kemp \\'s tearful bloodthirsty angst , and milano \\'s tearful rediscovery of her love , the \" tragic \" star-crossed ending , and the christian iconography , all mirror coppola \\'s bram stoker \\'s dracula ( 1992 ) . one senses that director goursaud was trying to rise above her porn material . however , this is no poor woman \\'s bram stoker \\'s dracula . milano is no winona ryder and kemp is no gary oldman . for that matter , none of the other talent on this film compare to their counterparts . and the budget just is n\\'t there . the strength of low-budget horror is a gritty authenticity , which this film tries to hide rather than utilize . how low was the budget ? listen , i was an extra on both bram stoker \\'s dracula and embrace of the vampire . ( in both instances , i kept my clothes on . ) i worked one day on embrace of the vampire . do n\\'t look for me , i ended up on the cutting room floor , and extras are rarely mentioned in credits . but let me tell you an \" inside story \" on the making of this film : we were shooting in a nightclub on the sunset strip . the extras were divided into three camps : union , nonunion , and modesto extras . union extras earn the most , especially once overtime kicks in , so they were wrapped after eight hours ( they were only hired in the first place to fill a union quota ) . this was during my nonunion days ( i \\'m in sag now ) , so i put in a full 14 hours , after which we were paid in cash and wrapped . the modesto extras were still working when we left . now what , you may ask , is a modesto extra ? i also wondered , and so i asked one . i was told they were from an acting class in modesto , california . they had been bussed in to work on the film as part of a \" class assignment . \" in other words , they were paying to come to work . there \\'s not a whole lot to learn about being an extra . it \\'s neither glamourous nor difficult . and nonunion extra jobs for twentysomethings are very easy to come by . the lampposts in los angeles are covered with flyers seeking cattle , ehr , extras . i did it for the cash , and because if you do it often enough , you increase your chances of getting into the union ( which i did , after some 13 grueling months ) . never pay for the \" chance \" to be an extra , not in los angeles . i made the mistake of volunteering to be an extra a few times , but wised up after a few months . my guess is the producers of embrace of the vampire paid this acting teacher to bus down some cattle , and far less than even nonunion extras cost . i know this teacher was getting paid by the students , and that they were not getting paid to be on the film . another inside story : someone stole a silver pin belonging to a crew member . she was near tears because it had sentimental value . never leave anything of value lying around on a set . and some trivia : john stanley says this film was \" originally conceived as the nosferatu diaries , \" but on the set , we were told the working title was the collector . embrace of the vampire is a decent time-killer ... barely . if you \\'re looking for horror , there are hundreds of better films . dozens of better vampire films . even many superior erotic vampire films - - vampyres ( british , 1975 ) comes to mind . but if you \\'re looking for milano nudies , this is the film to see . \\r\\n', \" ok !

Áron ( tamás mészáros ) is a young lad whose life seems warm at first until suddenly a disease of vision impairment attacks his mother and his parents divorce : the mother is somewhere in a hospital and the father ( sándor gáspár ) beats the boy and eventually turns him over to a rigid orphanage for boys run by cruel taskmasters . Áron undergoes initiation tactics by his fellow orphans but despite the beatings he is strong enough to survive . he is befriended when he has his nightmares about his mother 's blindness by his friend atilla ( szabolcs csizmadia ) and the two bond emotionally and physically . in this bleak atmosphere a little light comes from the beautiful young housekeeper anya ( krisztina somogyi ) but even her contributions are compromised by the cruelty of the staff . there is one ' teacher ' in the orphanage school , nyitrai ( lászló gálffi ) who has been reduced to his position as an ' imprisoned one ' by the government and his sadness is offset by his playing his cello and studying his beloved astronomy . nyitrai offers Áron solace and introduces his ' fellow traveler ' to the glory of the stars , giving Áron a map of the heavens that Áron cherishes - his window to a world beyond the dark confines of his prison-like orphanage . he gradually wins over his fellow orphans and when nyitrai , in the pit of depression for his life situation and the cruelty of the orphanage and the government , hangs himself . this horrid incident drives Áron to organize an escape from the orphanage , an event that is ultimately fractured with a death for which Áron feels responsible . and the end of the film fades into the many possibilities that event could trigger . the atmosphere created by the stunning cinematography by péter szatmári defines the darkness that represents the orphanage well but also suggests the darkness in hungary of that period . the musical score by péter

hamburg phase of the early beatles , and succeeds on every level . although purportedly intended primarily to tell the story of \" fifth beatle \" stuart sutcliffe , the focus quickly shifts to john lennon who ( as in real life ) dominated the music and lives of the early beatles . it is as much the story of stu and john as the story of stu and astrid , and explores the dynamics of both complex relationships . still , it is a fascinating look at the early beatles , who paid their dues by playing in some of the rough reeperbahn bars in the pre-fame years . the cast is excellent , and were obviously chosen for their talent rather than their resemblance to the characters they portrayed . the music is also excellent , and complements the story perfectly . in all , \" backbeat \" is an

\" and was sold but now as an adult i find i still like this movie and it reminds me of a true dungeons and dragons style adventure then almost any other movie ( including those terrible scifi d&d movies ugh ) it starts off with a prince and of course a princess yes been done before many many times but then in come the slayers and from then on its a totally different experience . with such ultimate favorites as the emerald seer , the widow of the web and the cyclops and of course the shapeshifting ( a bit daft too ) wizard with some very strange habits ( i dare not tell you so as not to ruin it ) but this is a classic movie and it will be good for generations to come . pros : cool effects ( for the time ) good story well done plot and themes cons : may be a bit too old for some and not flashy enough . but remember it is a tad old . its a 5 star easily some may not agree but judge the movie on its merits and not against those of today and anyone can see the care and detail that

awaiting this package . in five minutes i realized delorme is essentially useless to the backpacker / mountain biker ( et al ) . you can order quads very simply using the package , but at the zoom level appropriate for making an ordering decision the wonks at delorme decided they would make the map blank ( apparently to force you into buying electronic quads at $2.50 a piece ) . so , you need to actually know the quad you want before you order it . well , if i knew that , i would already own the quad , and certainly would n\\'t need to buy an electronic version . for 2.50 more i could get it laminated . yes , this is a flame , but it is deserved . delorme might be great software if you know the quad you want ; it is ridiculous software if you are trying to explore and area in order to decide where you want to go ( and then download , and pay for , the appropriate map ) . all in all , a complete waste of money- -i only feel it worth my time to write this review so that the suppliers

this is an excellent , fascinating and insightful read . dr guarneri knows her stuff and has writen this book well . she wrote it because obviously we need to think about nutrition , cholesterol and excercise , but there are deeper issues too like peoples emotions . she believes that heart problems can be caused by the stress 's in our lives and our emotions - we could litterally die of a broken heart . emotional events can weaken heart muscles . you produce stress hormones when you are upset which raise blood sugars and blood pressure etc which ultimately weaken or can destroy the heart . she talks about this in the book and on the flip side , talks about happy people too and how positive emotions and feelings do good for our hearts . when we are happy , our hearts beat in a coherent rythym . she says we have to look at our hearts in various ways . we need to look at it as a pump to keep us alive but to also look at the emotional heart , the mental heart and the spiritual heart in order to keep us healthy . i believe she knows her stuff and she wrote this well and has made it totally interesting and it 's looking at our hearts in a different way from other books on the same

as well as a huge abba fan . now i realize that sampling has been very successful for many artists.. . and apparently it is here as well , but why ca n\\'t these producers make something more intriguing or dynamic ? gimme gimme gimme ( the abba song that is sampled here ) is a fairly simple song to begin with ( as many abba songs are ) but the complicated arrangements ( both vocally and instrumentally ) are what made abba \\'s songs interesting and fun to listen to . but taking a few bars of the original song , repeating it over and over and over , adding a dance beat , various other musical effects and a new melody does not add up to a pop masterpiece . i think she would \\'ve been better off either following a similar chord progression to gimme gimme gimme or just doing a cover.. . perhaps benny and bj\\x1arn should \\'ve stuck to their strict \" no sampling \" rule here ! for some reason many of today \\'s dance / pop songs get too caught up in the production and lack any real substance.. . a good example of a radio-friendly dance / pop song with a somewhat complicated chord structure is acoustic alchemy \\'s \" so kylie \" on their american / english album ( the song sounds simple enough but if you really listen to what \\'s going on , you \\'ll notice subtle chord changes and a really nice progression ) . now i \\'m not going to say \" hung up \" is a terrible song , because everyone has their own taste . but i \\'m sorry to say it just does n\\'t do anything for me. . \\r\\n', ' i was happy at first when i got this memory card but when my phone

the creators included many very low resolution images that they \" artsied \" or \" roughed \" up with a dirty polaroid-transfer effect , or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides , which they must have hoped would excuse the poor quality of the original image . for example , if you do a search for \" tiger \" , you will get 165 results , but only 86 will be of the animal , ( and not one of 20 images of 10 toy tigers , or 5 images of one tiger-striped chair-cushion and so on ) , and of those 86 , 80 have the crusty effect applied to them . the other 6 tigers have been taken out of those same 80 images and clipped out of their background to give you a floating tiger on a clump of grass or a tiger head ( but have , thankfully , not been \" dirtied \" up with the transfer effect ) . out of all , there is not one clean image of a tiger in its environment . here is another example . a search for \" sunset \" yields 247 results . of these , 163 have the crusty polaroid transfer effect applied , and 70 are the same images duplicated ( much smaller ) in a sloppy stack of 5 slides . there are two clean sunset images . these are typical results . numbers do n\\'t mean anything ! this

contemporary . heart published in 1940 , and castle in 1948 , both about life in the 30s . both families are poor . in castle though , there is never any question that the girls might go off and get jobs . this is supposedly because they \" do n\\'t know how to do anything \" . so instead they sell off their belongings and get by on scraps of bread and the odd bit of butter . how charming ! they are \" eccentric \" , which seems enough in the author \\'s eyes to exempt them from the expectation of supporting themselves . only stephen the handsome young son of the late housekeeper , enamored of cassandra , does work and gives the family his entire salary . but he is of the class that is expected to toil after all . even he is rewarded in the end- -able to avoid labor with an easy job similar to that of step-mum topaz- -striking poses . unlike the looming and grinding poverty of heart then , the poverty in the castle never amounts to more than a lark- -educated folks playing at being poor until they \\'re rescued by romantic circumstance . not so in america where mick kelly , who did n\\'t know how to do anything either , went off to work at woolworth \\'s , and to a life of little hope . in castle the solution comes in the form of that classic deus ex machina , the inheritance . two dashing young wealthy americans one of whom has inherited the castle , show up just in time , with their chatty modern mum . they throw money around and talk too much , in the cliched extravagant american style . most of the remainder of the novel consists of cassandra and her sister rose swooning over one brother or the other , with an eventual romantic result that assures all the characters of economic well being . it \\'s all so very charming , bourgeois , and harmless . if your life is hard do n\\'t worry- -a man will show up to rescue you ! the reviews for this novel in amazon are overwhelmingly positive . smith was obviously talented . her writing is elegant and a

disc is , other than as an adam ant filler for those collectors who need to add more to their collection . this is a slightly scaled down version of the truly best of \" antics in the forbidden zone

from the 1995 \" wonderful \" album . these two songs are not really worth the cost of admission and i think are probably the weakest songs on those two albums , anyway . and of course \" essential \" ignores the unreleased 1993 album \" persuasion \" which had some really good songs on it . if you want later period adam ant , \" manners \" is really good and \" wonderful \" is , well , less than

happy with my purchase of this title and have such a more indepth & greater understanding of what is involved with tattooing . great buy \\r\\n', ' walzer \\'s historical approach to examining just war theory is , i think , the most useful way to understand morality in war . that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations . walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here ; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying , if not prescribing , moral norms from which the rules have been extracted . be forewarned , he does not cut the reader any slack . this book requires some serious attention to the author \\'s train of thought . just war theory has two categories : the justice of going to war , and the justice of fighting once in a war . walzer \\'s discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere . in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service . his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war . one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that \" all is fair in love and war . \" that is the path of least moral resistance ( or as clausewitz would say , \" friction \" ) , yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers . what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion , something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected . yet it remains a prevailing idea for many . originally coined by the romans it seems ( walzer quotes them , \" in war the laws are silent \" ) , they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians . the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone . some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist- -far from it . on the otherside some critics find his argument about \" supreme emergency \" a moral failure and a cop-out . the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency , one where normal rules may be relaxed , if ever so little , because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide . the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror . in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan , for instance , as having represented a supreme emergency , and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified . readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell \\'s perspective in the essay \" thank god for the atom bomb . \" significantly for current events , readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here . the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive . that impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects , i think , a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy . there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of \" pre-emption . \" michael walzer \\'s well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism , and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start , regardless of its practical success down the road , if we are fortunate enough to see that . the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future . the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco . where one fails to recognize the moral high ground , one is doomed to moral failure . walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003 , and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion ; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world \\'s police force \\r\\n', \" to say this film is self-indulgent is a masterpiece of understatement .

4. any stalag luft comandant worth his weight in sauerkraut would have just as soon killed the bruce willis character as look at him . as depicted in \" hart \\'s war \" , the camp commandant ( as portrayed by marcel lures ) would have had a very difficult time maintaining any sort of status as an officer in the german army . his collection of american jazz / blues records is a cute writer \\'s invention that has nothing to do with the reality of the situation , or of the type of men who were in charge of german pow camps . in reality , the marcel lures character would probably have been relegated to another type of nazi camp with a pink triangle sewn on the front of his tunic . 5. the storyline is not completely unbelievable - trials did take place in pow camps , one good example being the pow \\'s who were tried and hung in andersonville ; however , the whole idea that the camp \\'s commandant would actively participate in such a trial as sort of a jerry springer type advocate is ludicrous . 6. the idea that during the trial , a group of pow \\'s who escape go on a secret mission to destroy a nearby munitions factory is insulting . not only did nothing like this ever happen during world war ii , it degrades the bravery of those poor souls whose only act of heroism was to survive internment under harsh and sometimes brutal conditions . the german army simply was n\\'t that stupid . 7. i saw this film once and did n\\'t like it . i thought that maybe the second time would be better . it wasn\\'t . 8. beyond being sheer hollywood political correctness , \" hart \\'s war \" seriously misrepresents many of the more important aspects of internment . it ignores the real focus of life in such a stalag which , for most pow \\'s , was just day to day survival . also , the soldiers who served in our armed forces during world war ii and also happened to be african americans were n\\'t spineless , hapless dopes . 9. bruce willis playing the same role in variations of \" die hard \" over and over and over again is tiring . 10. better films about the same sort of subject matter are \" the tuskeegee airmen \" and \" stalag 17 \" . hopefully in a few years , \" hart \\'s war \" will be completely forgotten , and these dvd \\'s will be rotting in some landfill . \\r\\n', \" due to a canoe accident on vacation , mine went completely underwater for at least 5-10 seconds . but - only a trickle of water got inside . once that dried out , much to my surprise , both the af and vr functions worked fine . all that 's left is two small water spots on the inside of the objective lens ( okavango delta water is clean ! ) . do n't try this at home . next time i 'm even near a canoe , i 'll have everything in dry bags . \\r\\n\", ' when i get a sinus infection , it stays and builds much congestion . rx and over-the-counter has limited value . one event that led to my first ( i am 69 ) severe asthma event , which messed up my immune system and led to my first angina events which the brought open heart surgury . neilmed pre-mixed packets sound like the \" minor leagues \" compared to the above . when a thorough cleansing is needed to make the sinus areas hostile to infection , these little packets take the mess out of measuring your own salt and soda ( i.e. to make a mistake is painful even with the right salt ) . then there is a $15 price in local stores for 100 packets , or about the same on-line for 200. also a quick response from the vendor . \\r\\n', ' clothes are soft and smell great works just as good as any fabric softener out there and better for you , your family , and the enviroment \\r\\n', ' we have not received this item yet . please let me know the current status \\r\\n', \" i like wordperfect much better than microsoft word as it is easier to use . reviel codes solves a lot of problems when text wont behave . not available in word . i bought the x3 version because of some bad bugs in ver 12. , like not being able to export my address book without errors and mail merge problems . the price was right on amazon and it was easier that trying to fix 12. i do n't see a big difference between the two versions except that they fixed all the problems that i was having in 12. if an earlier version is working for you , i see no good reason to upgrade . b \\r\\n\", \" i grew up reading harold evan 's sunday times - in the late 1970s it provided a window on the world that few other papers could . i particularly remember comprehensive coverage of egyptian president sadats historic visit to jerusalem ; ongoing coverage of soviet dissidents and a very welcome ( i 'm irish ) editorial urging britain to consider withdrawal from northern ireland . however , from today 's perspective , the paper 's foreign coverage seemed to be written from a point of view which could be summarised as ` what would the world do without henry kissinger ? ' [indeed this has always seemed to be mr. kissinger 's view also] ; and that soviet unreasonableness was a product of american hawkish unreasonableness and that balance , compromise and reasonableness were achievable with enough negotiation . my memory is of positive disdain for the emerging tax revolt in california and absolute dread at the more confrontational foreign policy approach being urged by followers of governor reagan . a major positive for me was the explanatory diagrams and the furtively taken photographs of soviet missiles ( ss-20s ? ) being deployed in russian forests . i was reminded of these diagrams in 2002 / 3 when the modern sunday times gave excellent descriptions - supported by diagrams - of saddam 's mobile chemical / biological weapons labs - which turned out not to exist . in saying all the above , i mean both to pay tribute to harold evans and to put in context the criticisms i have of this book - which contains descriptions of his triumphs as sunday times editor and his difficulties as times editor under rupert murdoch . the book has three sections - the first describes some of the episodes which made evan 's sunday times great - the investigative reports from the insight team and others , of malicious cover-ups of poor quality in the pharmaceutical industry ( thalidomide ) and the aircraft industry ( mcdonnell douglas ) ; the publication of the crossman diaries - laying bare the rivalries and mutual disdain of the members of the british labour cabinet . having established his credentials as a ` vertical ' journalist - evan 's term , which he describes as ` seeking to get to the bottom of things ' - and lauding his proprietors , the thomson 's , for allowing him to do so , the second part of the book deals with the advent of mr. murdoch as owner . the machinations of murdoch to gain control are fascinating , the thomson 's were drained both financially and personally by the losses induced by union activity , and they secretly dealt with murdoch while other offers were being pursued by the editors . murdoch eventually won ownership of both the times and sunday times , having given guarantees of editorial freedom to a board of ` national directors ' , guarantees , which if breached , were theoretically amenable to criminal legal sanction . as part of the change of ownership evans was offered the editorship of the times - one of the free worlds most revered titles . in his description of the paper , evans reveals an almost po-faced reverence for the place of the times as part of the british establishment - he sees it as the paper of record , upholding fair , non-partisan and accurate journalism which british society has come to expect . one feature of this is his constant enumeration of people 's educational background , almost every colleague is named and then his / her school and university are listed - for example joe smith , winchester , oxford , to establish both social class and academic ( perhaps intellectual ) credentials . he documents the ` four pillars ' of the times as its reporting of parliament , its legal coverage , its obituaries and its leader columns . oh dear ! stolid stuff , from the fearless , vertical , investigative editor . nonetheless this section contains fascinating accounts of evan 's new broom editorship coming to terms with the rather lazy attitude to scoops and freshness of news which , by implication , criticise his predecessor as editor ( william rees mogg ) ; and show that change was indeed necessary at the institution . looming behind this story is murdoch 's general management style - haphazard interventions , secretive finances and lack of budgeting and planning . from the text it seems to me that murdoch was overstretched with transatlantic acquisitions , rather than covertly scheming to undermine evans . the third section of the book reads a bit like macbeth - murdoch plots to renege on his guarantees and to impose his will on the editors . the text here is well paced and descriptive - the tension plays havoc with everyone , save perhaps murdoch , evan 's second-in-command betrays him , various functionaries within the paper either resign or become lackeys , the ` national directors ' turn out to be paper tigers ( this is too good a pun to delete ) , the thatcher government sides with murdoch and fails to taken any action as the guarantees are broken , piecemeal . the thrust of this section reveals evans as tragic hero , valiantly striving to uphold freedom of speech against the devious , double-dealing murdoch , whose lackeys live in fear of his disapproval . however , by the time i got to this section i had , sadly , lost a lot of respect for evan 's impartiality , his defence of press freedom seemed to me to cloak an innate inability to face change in the form of new commercial and political realities . this was reaffirmed in my mind when , on the day that evan 's agreed to reign , who should phone to commiserate but henry kissinger ! in the end i think the book is important in that it is illustrates that one important feature of change and leadership is that they are neither comfortable nor , initially at least , popular . evans , though personally engaging - and i 'm sure mercurial and demanding - came to represent a set of fading political beliefs . the change occurring at the times these events described were taking place saw the emergence of economic individualism unleashed by lowering taxation rates ; the antipathy to organised labour and active military competition with the soviet union . the fading , indeed failing , social democratic consensus was overthrown by a more individualistic and competitive set of beliefs and the process was quite ugly , given the sincerely held beliefs on both sides . i believe evans and murdoch were representative shadows of this change . the rest of the story - evans attractive forthrightness , murdoch 's furtive acquisitiveness - while the human interest focus of the story , are ultimately a side show . this book is well told , highly dramatic and engaging , however seen at a remove of twenty five years it is a lament from someone who worked hard to become part of an establishment whose day was done . \\r\\n\", ' this is the 3rd , and unfortunately final , chapter in the triology . i got my husband to run

duffel bags , but none of them really worked all that well . then i saw the lowepro street and field system with completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , and accessories . it works great , you only get the pouches you need so there is no waisted space and you can organize them however you want according to how often they are used ( put frequently used items in easier to access places . ) the variety alone of this system is worth the investment , but the quality and ease of use is also very high which is a big plus . you can get a case for any lens , camera body , or accessory you have . i even have cases for my cell phone and water bottle . one word of caution , be sure to measure your lens with the lens hood on backwards if you use them to make sure that the entire thing will fit into the pouch , because sometimes the lens will fit , but then the lens with the lens hood will not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards and batteries , and a bunch of cleaning supplies and other gadgets , which weights a ton . but when they are evenly distributed on this vest / belt lowepro system it is actually very manageable . the only down side is that everyone will be staring at you because you have thousands of dollars of camera equipment strapped to your body . but if you can overlook that , this is the way to go . i have used this system at many zoos without ever having problems , in fact just unzipping a single lens and switching seems safer to me than opening an entire bag of equipment every time you want to switch lenses . many of the cases also come with a built in rain / snow cover so if the weather changes all of your equipment is not destroyed . you can also put just a few pouches on a normal belt when you are just going to take photos in the back yard or do n't need to take all of your equipment , which is nice . i really ca n't say enough about how much easier this makes traveling with a lot of equipment , if you have been hopelessly searching for a better solution , consider this , you wo n't regret it . \\r\\n\", ' the first cd from baby anne is fairly typical florida breaks fare . i would

a surprising mix from jen lasher , who has abandoned her old breakbeat sound and fully adopted a more electro feel . to those who have labeled this \" industrial \" i will say first and foremost that you are wrong . there is not one remotely industrial track on the cd . what she does provide is an extremely varied mix of synthpop , house , and a couple breaks tracks , all very vocal and sporting an electro pop flare , sometimes approaching the full-on ny electroclash sound . from someone quite familiar with electropop artists i ca n\\'t recommend highly enough this diverse mix guaranteed to please newcomers and electro afficianados alike . my only complaint is the strikingly misplaced wolfsheim track , which i can only assume fueled the misguided and completely false depeche mode

curiosity regarding the reactions of laramie 's townspeople to this tragedy that received national attention . matthew was a human being , undeserving of the cruel torture that led to his death . shameless hatred was definitely reflected by several laramie residents , but not everyone shared that view . that fact was refreshing . the law enforcement officer who freed matthew from the fence at the scene of the crime was incredibly sympathetic . her personal views concerning his lifestyle were not revealed , but her view of this youth as an innocent victim of a horrific crime were apparent . other laramie residents were just as horrified . the so-called clergyman who brazenly expressed a heartless sentiment to one of the interviewers was expected , but equally unnerving . this film , though actors portrayed the townspeople interviewed , has the feel of a documentary . knowing that the expressions were accurate was alarming at times . but the presentation was enlightening . the film addressed the fact that hate crimes are just that - crimes . no matter what a person 's viewpoint , lifestyle or background , no one has a right to take on the position of punisher . humans are not animals . or , at least they should n't act like them . the laramie project exposes the heart of many people after the matthew shepard murder . it is worth the watch \\r\\n\", \" what could have

for a long time . it could be categorised as belonging to the same genre of \" action fantasy \" as a number of hollywood films . examples of the rules of reality being abandoned : the action takes place in the middle of antarctic winter , and the author even notes at one point how it \\'s pitch dark outside , yet there are scenes on the ice that play out as if the characters could see each other . people spend minutes in freezing water , yet pop out none the worse for the wear . two close allies of the united states attack a us installation on no better motivation than a claim that a \" spaceship \" has been found there , shouted once through the radio . a 12-year-old girl goes through hours of commando troops shooting at each other in a closed facility without getting hurt physically , nor , apparently , mentally . a prototype airplane that has been buried in ice for over ten years , but that works perfectly on the first attempt to fly it . the stupidity goes on and on

symphonies but at a low cost . now first off , yes , they sound great . however , i \\'ve noticed a problem in the first movement of the fifth symphony : karajan changes beethoven \\'s orchestration ! allow me to explain : the horn players at the time would have been using valveless horns - - instruments bound to the overtone series . on the \" natural \" or \" hand \" horn , pitches that fall on the overtone series can be played without adjustment ( like a bugle ) but any other note must be bent into tune by using the right hand to close off the bell . this technique was effective in allowing the horn to play most chromatic pitches , however , the \" stopped \" notes have an entirely different tone color ; most composers favored \" open \" pitches , especially for symphonic works . in the exposition , the second theme is announced by a call in e-flat by the horns . however , in the recap , the same call must be in the tonic ( c ) , as dictated by sonata form . the horn part is written for e-flat horns , which meant they would have been tuned so that the harmonic series emphasised e-flat major , the relative major . the e-flat call of the exposition falls entirely on partials the hornists can play with no significant adjustment - - they are all \" open \" notes . however , in the recapitulation , the c call would include two \" closed \" notes if it were played by the e-flat horn . the horns could change crooks and become c horns , in which case the call would again be all open partials , but beethoven does not do this ; i am uncertain whether he wanted the horns in e-flat for the transition , leaving them no time to change , or if it was simply not yet common practice to change crooks in the middle of a movement . for whatever reason , beethoven left the horns in e-flat and rather than writing the call in the horns again , which would include stopped pitches and have a very different sound , beethoven moved the call to the bassoons . in karajan \\'s recording , the second theme is announced by the horns in both the exposition and the recapitulation . granted , if beethoven had been writing for our modern valve horns , he might have written both calls in the horn section . there is no way to prove for certain that this is the case , however . it strikes me as very arrogant to \" correct \" beethoven \\'s instrumentation , and i feel that a respect for historical accuracy by preserving the master \\'s writing is a more prudent performance choice . \\r\\n', ' i \\'ll start with the positive : the main character is a classic hero in every sense of the word - tall , good-looking , smart , humble , etc. the story was engaging and made for a quick read because it was easy to follow , carried the reader along and crafted as to have no wasted words . in short , it was a competent work of fiction . that \\'s where my praise ends , because this is the type of work that contributes to our national problems by feeding false stereotypes and radical agendas . sure , it \\'s a work of fiction , no one is going to take it seriously , yada yada yada . but that \\'s not true , is it ? so many people in this country believe that this the plot of this book is plausible and even to be encouraged - - just look at the reviews to find the believers . alright , here are my problems with it : first , politicians are corrupt and will sell-out anyone to maintain power , but that \\'s not true if you \\'re a conservative farm-boy elected despite your honesty from a midwestern state . in term limits , vince flynn just beats you over the head with the \" power corrupts \" mantra - he does n\\'t show it in the actions so much as just repeats it like the chorus of a bad rap song , yet from the lips of the marine combat veteran congressman who is our protagonist . you know what , though ? there are people in politics on both sides of the aisle who really want to do what \\'s right , who really are trying to make a difference for the positive , for this nation and the citizens . in this book , however , the public is a tool to be used and treated as if they are n\\'t smart enough to make good decisions . second , murder is a viable answer . this repeats another mantra that conservatives repeat often - that they do the hard fighting and living to protect this nation and its freedoms so that the liberals can live in their fantasy-land . come on , get real . this book touts a special forces unit as being so committed to the constitution that they are willing to murder high-level politicians and threaten the president with assassination if he does n\\'t balance the budget . and , they get away with it because it \\'s really the right side to be on . murdering our leaders is the answer according to vince flynn . murder solves the obvious weakness that we have as a nation , that being elections . elections apparently just get in the way . third , the balanced budget . for years and years - until the time this book was written - conservatives cried about the budget . the book makes it the central theme . balance the budget and make us fiscally responsible . it \\'s important enough for a military coup supported by the protagonist of this novel . a coup ! ! ! yet , when the conservatives did take power , despite vince flynn \\'s prescient forecasting ability , they ran the deficit into uncharted territory and did n\\'t flinch . even when confronted by this atrocity of fiscal irresponsibility , they claim that now ! ! ! ! ! the deficit is n\\'t a big deal , that it \\'s really just a function of the percentage of gdp and we ought to all forget about it . this book starkly reveals the disconnect between conservative priorities of the 90 \\'s and the realized result nearly two presidential terms later . it \\'s like looking back in time to a parade of nit-wits . fourth , the good guys do n\\'t do bad things . the special ops team kills only who they want and never any innocents - just the politicians . the bad guys leave a wake of messy slaughter and civilians whenever they use murder as a tool . flynn spends way too much time making this point and beating the reader over the head

at that early time . he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things did n't make much sense . well , from a layman 's perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging . it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic , physics and astronomy . even from my scientifically deprived perspective , a lot of things in the book did n't make much sense , such as the actual method of getting to the moon , but this does n't really take away from the book - it adds greatly to its appeal . the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous . i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work , and what these poor souls were going to come up with next . compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however , from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative . verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality , and much unlike his other works , does n't stray far from the earthly . some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion , but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read . if you drop at the sight of f ( x ) = y , then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking , centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate . if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today . if you ,

paul mccartney goes on tour to connect with his beloved audience , it usually for more than just the average \" oh , i have an album to promote , let me go on tour \" . his 1989 tour was paul \\'s first time onstage in many years , and he used it to show he not only still had the energy and vigor he posssessed during his beatles & wings years , but he also still was able to create a deep , personal bond with his audience like few if any other artists can . this spawned the excellent double live album \" tripping the live fantastic \" as well as the exciting concert movie \" get back \" . his 2002 american tour was a chance for paul to use the healing power of music to ease the seething sadness caused by the horrific attacks on september 11th . the cd and dvd \" back in the u.s. \" were released to commemorate this wonderful act of musical philanthropy . in 2005 , paul did something that had long been awaited since the beatles first hit . ever since the cold war , the beatles were a huge phenemenon in russia . however , there communist government considered their music alien propoganda , and their music was outlawed . still , the russian citizens got their hands on the beatles \\' recordings any way they could , and they felt a great deal of inspiration from them , making them belive there was a free world beyond the iron curtain . over 40 years later , paul ventured to moscow to perform a historic concert in red square to hundreds of thousands of devoted fans who had been waiting all their lives for this moment . the concert was filmed and was aired on a & e as \" paul mccartney - live in red square \" . this is quite simply an excellent concert movie . paul and his band are in top form . paul clearly wanted to give the russian fans a night they \\'d never forget , pouring his heart and soul as well as his boundless energy into old warhorses such as \" band on the run \" , \" live and let die \" , \" back in the u.s.s.r. \" , \" hey jude \" and \" let it be \" , as well as performing rarely heard numbers such as \" two of us \" , \" i \\'ve just seen a face \" and \" let \\' em in \" . mixed in with the live performances are commentaries by scholars and fans on how the beatles \\' music had such a connection with the russians during the cold war , and why they still remained so popular . these interviews manage to come off as insightful and entertaining rather than annoying and unneccessary , even when they occasionally cut off certain numbers . as an added bonus , we get another concert of paul in st. petersburg . this is once again an excellent , energetic and fun show that shows why paul to this day remains quite possibly the most beloved man in the music world . the sound and picture quality are excellent , and the special

getting with my 20d . and with a 5d at 3fps , i just said forget it...no way . i 'm not even a professional taking pictures for a living . this is just purely a fun hobby for me and stepping up from a 20d to this camera is out of this world . with the phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it 's like i 'm now playing with a bentley ( with the 1d mk2 n ) coming from a mercedes c230 hatchback ( the cheapest mercedes that people buy just because it 's a mercedes name and they do n't want to spend any more money on a real mercedes ) . this camera and the photos truly almost help me take pictures like a pro . also , i do n't shoot action pictures all the time , and i do love portrait photography , and landscapes and printing and blowing up large sized pictures . but even with the 1.3 crop factor , there is still a huge improved difference going from a 1.6 crop and you wo n't have vignetting problems with some lenses that you 'll have on a 5d . with this 1d mk2 n , you can still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc. as much as i 'd like to have 12.8mp like the 5d , 8mp is really all that we need these days unless you 're going to blow up and print photos that are larger than 8x10 's or around there . unless you 're printing extremely large posters and whatnot , you can pretty much do everything with this camera that the 5d can . the resolution and mp is definitely enough . plus , it 's also invaluable to know that you have the 8.5 fps available and ready to use if you need to and you can also tone it down and use a slower fps if you need to . the extra bonuses with this camera which i look at as a secondary positive , are the weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy to use and navigate menu system , you can see the iso information in the viewfinder as well as the lcd screen at all times , dual memory card capability , you can shoot on 2 memory cards at the same time as one for backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you do n't have to shell out extra for this ) , longer battery life than the other cameras , best customization and most options that you can set to your liking , more than the 5d or the 20d or 30d . i could go on and on but definitely get this camera if you can afford it . otherwise , the 5d is also a great choice too if you need to save the money , and all you do is take landscape pictures all day long , or never will have a use for fast action or have a need to capture quick moments , and do n't want the fast and most accurate focusing system that 's great for ai servo . \\r\\n\", ' to add on to the previous reviewers , i was very disappointed with this camera \\'s performance . i compared the \" 5 megapixel \" photos with photos taken with my canon , powershot g3 ( 4megapixels ) , and the scd6550 simply did not produce the same quality stills . the camera itself also seemed flimsy . the idea of having a two-in-one camera is so attractive . but another attractive concept , canon \\'s elura50 , offered a camcorder with a compact design . in the end , however , it broke down only after a year and a half . for a $500 purchase that is not a durable lifespan ( cf. reviews for elura50 and you will see that many are having hardware problems ) . this camera seemed less durable than the elura50 as i maneuvered the various parts and dials . of course , i am returning the camera before it can prove its durability . nevertheless , maybe the folks at cnet can stake their money on it . lastly , i should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed . i found that i had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button . this definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments . again , this camera is a great idea . but , i suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording . this one is on the right track , but , still so far from accomplishing a quality product . \\r\\n', ' these glasses are a great idea . however , they do not work with long hair . the back \" strap \" of the glasses has to ride high up on the back of the head for the lenses to rest low on the nose ( so you can see over them for

acids . flaxseed is nature \\'s richest storehouse of omega-3 fatty acids , and contains more than twice as much omega-3 oil as fish oils , and it costs less , ounce for ounce . flax also contains other important substances like lignans , which may protect against some types of cancer . the husks of the seeds are rich in mucilage . both the seed oil and mucilage have many nutritional and therapeutic properties . there are many potential benefits from taking flax seed oil : flaxseed oil lowers cholesterol levels , thereby improving cardiovascular health and lessening the risk of arteriosclerosis . flaxseed also contains plant nutrients like phytoestrogens . these are natural estrogen-like substances that can lessen the discomfort of menopause . flaxseed oil may lower high blood pressure . flaxseed oil helps some people improve their psoriasis and eczema , as it has anti-inflammatory properties . flaxseed may also reduce the itching , swelling , and redness associated with certain skin disorders such as acne . flaxseed oil has a positive effect on rheumatoid arthritis due to its ability to calm inflammation . flaxseed reduces ldl ( low-density lipoprotein ) cholesterol ( the body \\'s \" bad cholesterol \" ) and lowers triglyceride levels . research shows that flaxseed oil gives much better protection against heart attacks than canola oil or olive oil . taking flaxseed may reduce cancer risk . this is because flaxseed contains the richest sources of lignan building blocks , which play a major role in preventing cardiovascular diseases and cancer . new research indicates that the lignans in flaxseed have both short-term and long-term protective effects against colon cancer . nature made flaxseed oil is a quality source of flaxseed oil , as the company is well-known and reputable . one tip : keep your flaxseed oil away from light and heat , as both degrade the oil . the usual beneficial dose of flaxseed oil is 2-3 capsules once per day taken with a meal . the benefits of flaxseed oil are cumulative . commit to taking it every day without fail . like any herbal supplement , do n\\'t expect dramatic quick results . the results you get will be subtle at first and then build over time . for specific conditions such as rhematoid arthritis , exzema , psoriasis , acne , etc , . the results should be apparent in 4-8 weeks . be patient ! know

films . the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world , this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world \\'s women while replacing powerful males with surgically-altered substitutes ( leading to , perhaps , the most prescient line of dialogue in any 1960s film- -upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be , a disbelieving flint says , \" an actor as president ? \" ) . that is , until a renegade zowie general ( steve inhat ) decides it \\'s his turn to take the reins of power . the delightful lee j . cobb is back as flint \\'s curmudgeonly boss , cramden , as are the secret agent \\'s posse of female admirers , and tv \\'s batgirl , yvonne craig , even shows up as a russian ballerina . \" in like flint \" feels more grown up than the previous film , partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody . notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind- -and charging a premium for them- -are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows , cross-dressing , and the bouncing sing-a-long ball . only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth

, the 3rd superintendent battle book , and the 2nd colonel race book , and has no narrator . it \\'s the first case in which superintendent battle , mrs. oliver , or col . race appear together with poirot or each other , and the only case in which *all* do so at once . the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes , where poirot encounters mr. shaitana , a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip . shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose , which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case - but it becomes clear that he \\'s a victim waiting to happen . for shaitana , like a few other collectors in christie \\'s universe , has succumbed to a foolish temptation , and begun collecting *people* - and not just people of talent or genius , but murderers . and being a connoisseur , he collects only the best : those who have gotten away with it . he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby , without naming names , and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of \" tigers \" ( poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger , but would do so from outside the tiger \\'s cage , having respect for the danger . ) poirot accepts the supper invitation , however , to find that there are seven other guests , including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers : explorer major despard , a strong silent type ; mrs. lorrimer , a middle-aged widow who is *very* serious about bridge ; timid young anne meredith ; and dr. roberts , a loud and jovial general practitioner . shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder , but otherwise the subject does not come up , and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper - arising from the final game to find their host dead , stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players ! this is , of course , poirot \\'s fantasy case , as he once remarked in the abc murders - because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another . there are only the people themselves , and their memories of the evening , and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed . solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved . but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator - or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they \\'d committed and gotten away with ? rather than following poirot \\'s viewpoint in third person throughout , some chapters follow battle , race , or mrs. oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case . each represents a different style : battle is a professional police officer , race an empire-builder-type secret agent , and mrs. oliver a writer of detective stories . battle , of course , has a duty to investigate shaitana \\'s murder , and does so in an orthodox style , cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him . race deals with checking out major despard , the explorer who \\'s most clearly his kind of person . mrs. oliver , for her part , works on worming information out of not only anne meredith , but her roommate rhonda ( whose attitude is that anne could \\'ve lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she \\'d been paying attention ) . and , of course , there \\'s poirot . he \\'s really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn , pursuing two major lines of questioning : ( 1 ) describe how the bridge games played out , and ( 2 ) describe the scene of the murder ( the elaborate collector \\'s room in shaitana \\'s house where the bridge games were played ) . see if you can figure out where poirot \\'s questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues , and what he learned from the responses he received \\r\\n', \" i bought one of these for my canon sd-800 and can recommend it . for many years now ,

) . that was a good decade for music ! 3. \" pull out the pin \" - the piano arrangement is excellent in this song and the chorus is so good . the lyrics are about someone who is in war and thinking about pulling out the pin of a grenade . the song was inspired by a documentary . 4. \" suspended in gaffa \" - i do n\\'t actually know what gaffa is but this song is still so great and catchy . the lyrics are quirky and the instrumentation is excellent . 5. \" leave it open \" - an excellent song that reminds me more of \" hounds of love \" . the instrumentation is excellent as always . 6. \" the dreaming \" - another brilliant song which is so funny because of bush \\'s australian accent . the production is good and so is the songwriting . 7. \" night of the swallow \" - the use of irish traditional music is a nice effect to this song . the singing by bush is superb and the song is flawless ! 8. \" all the love \" - the song has a sadder feel to it but is excellent . the lyrics are unusual and very well done . the instruments complement bush \\'s superb voice and never overtake ! 9. \" houdini \" - the album cover is to do with this song . the song is excellent with a really quirky chorus and good instrumentation . 10. \" get out of my house \" - a perfect way to end an amazing album . the lyrics are so good and it is so funny at the end when she turns into a mule ( within the song obviously ) . it is something only kate bush could have written !

i used it for the first time on my legs . i \\'m not going to lie...it was painful . i just made sure to go slowly , pausing every few inches , and making sure my skin was pulled as tightly as i could get it . eventually , i was able to get most of the thick , dark hairs off of my legs . **please know that the epilator is not an immediate \" cure-all \" . hair grows in stages , so as soon as you get rid of some hairs , several more grow in behind them . ( eventually you can probably get rid of most to all of them , but it will take some time . ) because of this , it is good to try epilating a couple of times a week . since it \\'s winter , i just let it all grow out so that the epilator can get more hairs . however , when new hair grows in , i am finding that they are thinner and blonde instead of dark brown . it does n\\'t hurt nearly as much to pull those out ! i also know that i \\'ll be able to do this in the spring and summer because the hair is lighter . my legs are smoother and i do n\\'t get razor burn ! right after epilating , sometimes i do experience a little irritation but , unlike razor burn , it goes away after just a short time . another neat thing is that , unlike waxing , the epilator can grab the teeny tiny almost invisible hairs . this gives your skin a smoother feel and it gets hairs at the beginning stages of growth ! i used to have to wait two weeks or so for my hair to grow long enough to be waxed . now , i get smoother skin just about whenever i want to ! i was a little nervous at first about spending money on a product i had not heard much about . with the exception of the few reviews i read online , i was pretty much in the dark . i went ahead and went for it , then realized that this thing paid for itself in about two weeks ! not only have i epilated my legs , i have also used it under my arms , on my upper lip , and on my bikini line . the results have been better than i could have imagined ! ! again , i \\'m not going to lie...ouch ! ! ! ! ! epilating under my arms hurt initially and they were sore for a few days ( i have very thick hairs ) . however , i got the majority of the hairs and after the first time , i realized that i \\'m never going to have to shave again ! yes , some little blonde hairs grow back , but they are all thinner and much less painful . in fact , sometimes it tickles a little . :o ) i epilate there once to twice a week ( about a five minute job if you \\'re being careful , two if you \\'re in a hurry ) and i have smoother underarms ! i used to get my upper lip waxed about once a month . now i just epilate . it hurts , but just for a second . plus , i keep up with it so instead of 50 hairs being pulled at once with hot wax , i only need to pull 5-10 each time . **a word of caution : our skin is more sensitive in some areas , so if you choose to epilate around the bikini line , be careful . i managed to give myself a burn from going too slowly with the rotating \" blade \" . now i just make sure that i do n\\'t leave it in one place for more than a couple of seconds . if i miss some hairs , i come back another time to get them . this epilator comes with a little loufa pad to help reduce ingrown hairs ( i \\'ve only had a few and the pad fixes them ) and a little cleaning brush . the epilator is very easy to clean . the top ( dark purple section ) pops off and you run it under hot water . when it dries , you put it back on . **note , the epilator does not store hairs inside of it . when they are pulled out , they tend to either gather on the front of the epilator ( i stop periodically to wipe them off ) or they go flying . i sit on a towel when epilating to catch most of the hairs . i hope this review was helpful to you with your decision about buying an epilator . i am very satisfied with this product and i recommend it to anyone who has at least a little pain tolerance and really wants to get rid of hair stop having to shave all the time . **are the few minutes of pain worth it ? ? ? absolutely ! :o ) \\r\\n', \" molly

most of the drills that i used with my team were effective . this video is for the first or second year junior high coach ( like myself ) or any coach on the recreational level ( ie . cyo and / or pal coach or just in your driveway with your son or daughter ) . they are not too difficult to follow and supplementary drills can be created easily enough . the narrator uses the expression \" dual purpose \" drills which translates into getting more than one benefit from any drill . combining shooting along with conditioning is used in most of the shooting drills . for instance , a drill with 3 players , one shooter , one rebounder and one passer . a simple drill but after the shooter shoots , he sprints to the wall and then back to his spot . the timing is such that when he gets back to his spot , the passer is already passing the ball . thought this aspect of the drill was just staged for the video but when i tried it , it worked great ! other drills also worked well like \" shots across the lane \" and a few of the rebounding drills . the explanations were mostly of the drills themselves and not too much on the x \\'s and 0\\'s . added tips are given if you listen close enough and the foul shooting and regular shooting techniques are discussed in a clear concise manner which turned out to be my favorite part of the video . the drills are forty five seconds to about a minute long . the sample practices given at the end of the video will be extremely helpful to any recreational coach . the video could have been more detailed with more theory ( which i like ) , but in truth , it gives you just what it says . some very good drills along with a superior format for a sports instructional video make this a buy \\r\\n', ' this is as bad as the film.in fact just like the film

works exactly the same as any sony cybershot : press halfway to focus , and all the way down to capture the shot . the zooming buttons do not work for the sony dsc-r1 as the camera has a manual

yes , i 've earned a few bucks with my prose . i 'm also a sucker for historic tales , ancient folklore , mythology and old testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits . ok , i decided , now that it 's in paperback , i 'll give it a read . what i concluded was this : those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown 's work is a literary steaming pile . i read page after page , waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat 's ass about the da vinci code 's protagonists . what a bunch of twits . langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology ( i do n't know if i spelled that right , but i 'm not about to go back in that book and check it ) . apparently , there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon 's books sell better than brown 's , entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status . sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who 's easy on the eyes - - someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he was n't a dipwad like landgon . she 's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough , but she 's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most french probably could n't tolerate it . and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing . from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near ( but , of course ) versaille , this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro . so he 's been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion , opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything . or something like that . oh , i forgot , teabing 's crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him . anyway , this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do - - make lofty , self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world 's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag . the point is that these characters are n't very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it . hell , it 's been more than 100 years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution , yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world . but back to how bad this book is . trite does n't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase . i would give you some examples but , like i said , i 'm not going back in there . one of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor . by now , sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times , been on the run and are exhausted . with a straight face , brown describes how sophie 's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by.. . crumpets . yes , crumpets . hell , teabing , shut up about your conspiracy theories , roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat . offer langdon a stiff drink . i sure needed one at this point . by now i 'm pulling for the albino . then they escape the jaws of death yet again and , naturally , high-tail it to england on teabing 's private jet . i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he 'd left his grey poupon behind . i stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the albino was n't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists . i do n't know how it ends . i do n't care . however , there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery . who knows ? you might like

of my co-workers in regards to movies to watch , at least when it comes to the horror genre . numerous people where i work told me that this movie , \" the descent \" was absolutely one of the best horror movies ever to be made . in their defense , my co-workers were n\\'t the only people with this opinion , many critics and other moviegoers said the same thing . well , apparently the hype that was built up for me regarding this movie was more than the film could live up to , because i was sorely disappointed , but more on that later , for now i will give you my plot summary for last year \\'s supposed horror spectacular , \" the descent \" \" the descent \" begins with a young woman on vacation with her family and friends , when her husband and her daughter suffer a tragic accident . one year later at the prodding of those same friends , she accompanies them on a spelunking adventure , the problem is none of her friends have ever been to this cave , in fact it \\'s a newly discovered cave that no one has explored as yet . so as they attempt to explore the unexplored these brave young women become trapped in the cave . making matters worse , this cave is not like any ordinary cave , for this one is inhabited by bloodthirsty mutant creatures who have just found their next meal . at the beginning of watching this movie i was really interested in the developing story , and the shocking opener really caught my attention , giving me a sense that this movie is going to be different than most horror movies by actually giving you the unexpected . however , once the story gets to the part where the girls are inside the cave , which is actually where the majority of the film takes place , things begin to go awry for the picture . at first , the filmmakers were doing a good job of using the claustrophobic atmosphere , giving the audience a sense of entrapment and anxiety which served to heighten the suspense regarding the possibility of impending doom . then the filmmakers introduce a fact that i felt completely derailed the movie , this is a cave that no one has been in , and these girls are hardly professional . so , who in their right mind would put all of their friends lives in possible jeopardy just to be the first to explore a newly discovered cave . it \\'s absolutely stupid , especially when placed viewed in the context of the character \\'s interaction and companionship with each other , none of these girls would do this to each other . after this occurs the mutants show up , a plot point that i was hoping would help put the movie back in the right direction ; however , this is where the movie begins to unwind even faster , because it \\'s now just one gory scene after another , and the movie is nothing more than your average monster movie . a decision i somewhat agreed with , yet still did n\\'t agree with was the decision to keep the mutants origins unknown . on the one hand this served to add to the mystery of why they are attacking these girls , you just assume they \\'re cannibalistic , but on the other it would have been nice to know how they got there . even though \" the descent \" was hyped as being one of the best horror movies of recent time , by both my friends and many critics and moviegoers , to me it was merely another average addition to a genre that is already full of mediocrity . \" the descent \"

asked question : is windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro has a more high-end networking features that most home users will never miss or would even know were missing . so for most users windows home edition is fine . they both are based on the same code and are almost identical . if you 're thinking of upgrading from windows 2000 , i did , because i like the gui interface better . but windows xp is as stable as windows 2000. so it 's your call . the plug-and-play ability of windows xp is totally great ! windows xp will by default find most drivers for video card sound cards , network cards , etc. that is such a bonus gone in the days of having to search for cds with drivers . i recommend upgrading to windows xp be a professional or home edition . it is a great

better , should have been better and yet , it just wasn\\'t . it featured an ensemble cast of the young and hot stars of the 1980s , the so-called brat pack ( well , everyone but molly ringwald and anthony michael hall , who were spared this misstep ) . maybe this was supposed to be \" the breakfast club - - after college \" , but while \" the breakfast club \" had characters , even stereotypical characters , that you could relate to , there is absolutely no one , with the exception of emilio estevez \\' character , that you care enough about to relate to in this film . the setting is not the john hughes teen friendly illinois , but georgetown , where our bunch of brat packers have supposedly graduated from college . uh-huh . yeah , right . judd nelson and ally sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is , nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that sheedy , in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that . andrew mccarthy is their mutual friend who knows what nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for sheedy ( or maybe it \\'s just the pearls ? ) emilio estevez is a future attorney , working as a waiter / server and suffering a serious crush on andie macdowell . mare winningham is a dowdy , trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity , working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her . she instead fantasizes about rob lowe , who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band , who has dropped out of school , married a white trash-y looking groupie , had a child with her and has now separated from her , and taking up with other groupies . demi moore is the wild chick who works in international banking , has a serious coke problem , stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of billy idol . sounds promising , huh ? well , in what is an early portend of the \" melrose place \" to come , sheedy finds out what a dog nelson is , dumps his ass , immediately jumps into bed with mccarthy , who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job ; estevez , after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there , travels to the snowy mountains to track down macdowell and profess his love to her . he finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed , he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home . lowe , in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere , takes winningham \\'s virginity and heads back to his estranged missus . moore , after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother , has all her furnishings repossessed , loses her job and freaks out . not exactly \" the breakfast club \" . the real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves . with the exception of estevez \\' character , they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped . their every action , every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional . their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that . winningham \\'s character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed lowe around like a sick puppy , knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was . and yet , she still gave her virginity to him . maybe if winningham was n\\'t so bright , or she was a college freshman , it would be understandable . but she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent . lowe really had little to do with his role . maybe if he had played the role nelson had - - as the roving lothario , with sheedy waiting at home , it might have gone over better . with his too-pretty looks , it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him . nelson just does n\\'t seem comfortable and does n\\'t pull it off - -but maybe nelson might have been better suited for the sax player . moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems , mirroring her character - - but was later rehired . while the title song later become a minor hit , \" st. elmo \\'s fire \" itself missed the mark . \\r\\n', ' like the other reviewer of this cd , i am also a fan of buffalo tom . unfortunately this does n\\'t sound very similar to bt , in fact it is a bit dull . none of the songs seem to have hooks or melodies that stick - after you hear it you instantly forget it . i gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be fair , since i only played it 3 times , hoping it would grow on me . i \\'d recommend \" up here \" instead of this one , it \\'s much more listener friendly \\r\\n', ' i would argue that since we really have n\\'t evolved all that far since our primate days human males still have loads of aggression and animalistic behavior they need to get out . and despite the best efforts from civilization in general to neuter them that aggression still has to go someplace . in mary harron \\'s \" american psycho \" it comes out in all the wrong places . the film is a character study of one patrick bateman ( christian bale ) , a wall street yuppie by day and an ax murderer by night . patrick is a man who has been forced to the edge because of the fakeness that surrounds him . it \\'s not just the suits and the empty conversations either . it is the peeing contests over who has the best haircut or apartment or business card . he tries to talk about his problems , he really does , but nobody listens to him because nobody listens period . to their ears \" murders and executions \" is interchangeable with \" mergers and acquisitions . \" the film is a big punch in the face to the egotistical businessmen of the 1980\\'s . this particular gordon gekko is overdone and overacted by christian bale in a great performance . he is robotic , phony , arrogant and absurd . he is the kind of guy who will have a 3 some with prostitutes just so that he can admire himself in the mirror doing so ( all the while flexing his biceps ) . more than anything he is militantly materialistic . he is dexter mixed with jim profit , only he likes to style and profile while taking an ax to a co-workers head . the whole point , which is made clear in the final scene , is that while these people may truly believe that only the glossy veneer matters it is really the inside that counts . just because these people make enough cash to swim in , scrooge mcduck style , does n\\'t mean that their behavior is excusable . harron paints the modern businessman as an american psycho , and it is all too fitting . to make it in the business world your conscious and your soul must be turned off , you must be turned into patrick bateman . the film is a great success . as a horror movie villain patrick has one of the most compelling backstories ever . every scene has great energy to it and even though bale looks a little out of place his acting is so good you ca n\\'t stop watching him . there is something of a conflict presented when willem dafoe shows up to play a detective on the case of one of patrick \\'s murders . that storyline is interesting while it lasts , but it is never quite wrapped up . i would also admit that after awhile i got a little sick of swimming in these debaucherous waters . he may never tire of having it dirty and bloody but i eventually did . the character is endlessly fascinating ( what is up with his love of cheesy 80 \\'s music ? ) and the scene where he kills paul allen will leave you stunned and hypnotized . the male need for aggression is n\\'t going anyplace and we need to find a good way to channel it . . .otherwise we are going to have a lot more patrick bateman \\'s and iraq wars on our hands . ***3 / \\r\\n', ' a great exercise tape- -plenty of variety and feels like it is doing the trick . if only denise would come into the house and make me exercise daily , this would really work

\\'s article entitled , \" sweet sorrow , \" published in the june-july 2006 issue of hispanic magazine ( page 76 ) . it is an honor and a pleasure to offer these few reflections on lila downs \\' new cd , la cantina : 1. the cd cover is awesome , a beautiful and colorful work of art illustrating lila in a pensive and contemplative mid-air pause with her guitarra ready to rock . it strikes me as an example of the rising feminine in our time , awakening the historically-oppressed feminine from its slumber and into an alto canto of unstoppable and celebratory song . 2. each track is a lively composition of mexican corridos and sones impregnated with lila \\'s lovely voice that makes me feel so proud to be mexicano-chicano-hualahuisense and a member of our precious universal human family . 3. i first was introduced to lila downs and her musical talent when i enrolled in writer juan felipe herrera \\'s legendary manikrudo summer arts class at cal state fresno in 2000. juan felipe invited her to our class room and she impressed us all with her down-to-earth talented voice . later that night we all saw her in concert at the tower theatre in fresno and i \\'ve been a fan of her work ever since . 4. this new cd is indeed a delightful experience . i appreciate that she moved into the corrido , son , etc. genres which makes me appreciate her music so much more . it has so much more appeal to me without bordering on the commercial and superficious . it \\'s authentic and retains its articistic musical integrity . i think that this is a hallmark that we can expect from all of lila \\'s work . she is a true artist . i \\'ve always appreciated her darker and earthier songs in her first two cds , however , this new stride into popular folk corridos is a movement into another aspect of the heart and soul of the mexicano experience . 5. i am very impressed with lila \\'s voice and how it has matured since the summer of 2000. there seems to be more color and flair in it and definitely mucho corazon . ahua ! her solos in \" yo ya me voy , \" have my soul spinning to the outer edges of infinity . as victor cruz-lugo writes , \" through it all , downs \\' powerful alto voice cuts a path into the deepest pits of your heart , tears something out of there and somewhow we as listeners wind up asking her for more of the same . \" this is my favorite of lila \\'s repertoire . it is my opinion that those who purchase this cd will not be disappointed . enjoy ! \\r\\n', ' i started with elements 3 and thought it worked great . i have elements 4 and can see it got

o\\'clock high \" and i had at least two models of the \" memphis belle \" when i was kid , all of which simply reflects the fact that the b-17 flying fortress is my favorite airplane . when i was a kid my family was driving through california and there was a b-17 parked out on somebody \\'s front lawn on a ranch and for years i tried to figure out how to go back and see it . a couple of decades later one of the few b-17s still flying came to the zenith city and i finally got to go inside one ( this big bombers are a lot smaller than i ever thought ) . for all i know that particular b-17 ended up flying in the 1990 film \" memphis belle . \" when i had occasion to drive through the city of memphis , of course i made a point of visiting mud island where the \" memphis belle \" was on display ( she was moved to the air force museum in dayton , ohio this october ) . the \" memphis belle \" ( serial no . 41-24485 ) was one of 12 , 750 b-17 flying fortresses built by the boeing aircraft company , but it was the most famous because it was the first heavy bomber to complete 25 combat missions over hitler \\'s europe without losing a crew member . the idea of 25 missions and going home was established by the bomber command as an incentive for air crews because morale was desperately low after the first three months of american combat flights over europe during which eighty percent of the planes were shot down . the \" belle \" flew from november 7 , 1942 to may 17 , 1943 and its final flight is the fanciful subject of this film directed by michael caton-jones ( \" scandal \" ) from the script by monte merrick ( \" staying together \" ) . that simply means that besides the fact that the \" memphis belle \" was named for a lady friend ( margaret polk ) of the pilot and that the art on the nose depicting the same ( designed by the famous artist george petty ) there is nothing here that is historically accurate when it comes to that final mission , which was over lorient , france and not bremen , germany ( the \" belle \" flew there on its 21st mission ) . the names of the crew are all changed and i think the same applies to the plane \\'s mascot , a scotty dog named \" stuka . \" so if you want something closer to the \" true \" story of the pilot robert morgan and the \" memphis belle \" you want to check out william wyler \\'s 1944 documentary \" the memphis belle : a story of a flying fortress . \" what you have here instead is a hollywood movie that celebrates the men who flew these bombers in world war ii by incorporating a wide variety of clichés from war movies involving airplanes . then there is the whole idea that americans from all walks of life who have little in common besides a desire to get home alive band together to fight the nazis . so it is we have the young and recognizable faces of matthew modine as the business like pilot , eric stoltz as the poetic radio operator , tate donovan as the co-pilot who wants to actually do something before he goes home , d.b. sweeney as the navigator who is convinced his number is up , billy zane as the bombardier who left medical school to fight , sean austin as the runt who is stuck in the ball turret , reed edward diamond as the flight engineer , courtney gains and neil giuntoli as the bickering waist gunners , and harry connick as tail gunner and sometime crooner . back at the base david strathairn plays the commanding officer nervous about his boys getting back alive and john lithgow is the public relations officer the army has sent to celebrate the final mission of the \" belle . \" of course , it is hard to create tension given that most viewers know the \" memphis belle \" is remembered for completing that final mission , so any tension that is created tends to be somewhat artificial although there are some nice moments during the bomb run ( the film might play better if it simply inspired by the \" belle \" and they changed the name of the aircraft as well ) . but even if the \" belle \" survives there are other several b-17 crews on the mission who will not . still , the idea that doing your duty could not just be dangerous but be outright suicidal is communicated , allowing modine \\'s character to explain the job to his nervous crew and underscore that americans do not believe in collateral damage . but what will probably stand out in this film is the grim lesson that donovan \\'s character learns when he tries to be a hero by doing somebody else \\'s job . \\r\\n', ' thought it would be insightful but it was just dull

haunting the estate ? why is he making contact with john russell ? as the film moves forward , john russell contacts a medium and eventually begins to investigate the mansion . from what he can gather , it was the former home of senator carmichael ( melvin douglas ) . what ensues is the mystery of who the child is , and who is senator carmichael . what occurred in the mansion that is keeping this child there ? this is more of a mystery than a horror film . the suspense of the film is through the nuances the director created by use of creepy sounds and effects in which the boy \\'s wheelchair moves . the film is dated , and does not have the appeal it once had for me , however , it is still a good watch . recommended . \\r\\n', \" other similar products were too complicated . all i wanted

they are just giant scale books that are reemed out like saw dust totally useless , which leads to the great difficulty on how to actually find an explantion to this jargon and then someone comes along and says they have an answer that will make things clear but then they fall short ) up until half the the book and many times periodically things are just repeated terminology loosely defined such as hook which is just recording industry jargon not theory . book never goes into the physical principals that would actually explain some things in it as to why the notes themselves are in the order they are such as acoustics , never got an answer as to what a whole step or a half step was by the way and when i asked many teachers and questioned them they knew nothing or gave a circular answer defining it themselves without an outside reference only to find that they were just parroting it all along . the problems with this is everything is assumed in the entire field . i recommend the only book that i have found that made some sense to me called fractals in music by charles madden much more organized and assembles things from the very beginning working into more and more complex shapes and structures . \\r\\n', \" if you are shooting with a compact chip camera like the 20d or rebel xt , you will be happier with the 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye will just be a really

data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly-anna conclusion : that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good . fukuyama proves that the moral consensus - - the social capital - - of the earlier era has been wiped away . that crime has sky-rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men . then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital . he does n't bother to deal with societies - - like ethiopia - - that have never been able to build up enough social capital . he does n't really look any further back in history past about 1950. his generalizations about the 19th century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history . he thinks ( based on his ideology of human goodness ) that things just have to get better . if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history , he would know better . people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long-term historical cycles . for that , i would recommend robert w . fogel 's & quot ; the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism . &quot ; fogel , a nobel prize winner , has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up \\r\\n\", \" this program is dependable and

cailifonia clients until one of them is murdered . when he is considered the main suspect , he goes on the run , with his only friend being the wife of a politician . at the begining he tells people that he is a moral man , for example , he dos n\\'t service gays , more on that in a moment . it is interseting to note that gere also played in a movie about hookers a decade later in \" pretty woman \" and it made a star out of julia roberts . but that is where the similarities end . this is a much darker story about hypocracy . when he falls under suspicion all his clients that liked him before all distance themselves from him . in the end , he finds himself a hypocrit , because in order to get an aliby he is willing to do anything job ; gays , s and m , anything to avoid jail . the only love story here is about him and the politician \\'s wife ( lauren hutten ) . it is complicated by the fact that he will not let anyone in close to him , even for his own protection . for all it \\'s darkness there is one funny scene . richard gere is called in for a line up at the police department . he tells the other men in the line up that he got paid , and the others get angry and cause a scene , averting the attention off of gere . this is a really good movie as an examination of society \\'s attitude toward sex . this film was written and directed by paul schrader , if that is why it seems like a less brutal companion to \" taxi driver \" . richard gere is wooden , but his character is cold and icy , so that approach is right . lauren hutten is alright as the bored housewife of a powerful man ; she seems sincere in wanting to help gere . but i thought the standout performance was bill duke as the slezzy street pimp who is quiet but menacing ( as oppose to gere \\'s \\' madam \\' ) , but also provides the warning to gere at the beginning that his 15 minutes of fame are running out . and another future \" pretty woman \" player is present ; hector elanzo . he plays the

story . if you want to see great versions . i highly rate the 1944 movie with orson wells though it is another abreviatd version , that movie truly captured the spirit and feel . it is moody dark and mysterious . another is the fantastic timothy dalton version which is most accurate to the book of all the movies taking actual lines right from the brontes story . dalton 's and clarkes acting is

harold \\'s brother is mia in wwii , not in vietnam , as the amazon.com review erroneously states ) . second , the writing is superb . mr. lawrence makes you feel emotions without telling you what to feel . his characters are very real . his setting ( a small , struggling circus , traveling the western u.s. ) is historically believable , peopled with \\' freaks \\' who suffer as sideshows , unable to find any other way to live because of the bodies they were born with , but peopled also with \\' normals \\' who are either afraid of or cruel to the freaks . harold , the 14-year-old albino central character , tries to straddle both groups of people . he finds his niche in the circus as an elephant trainer . i am admittedly ignorant about such things , but mr. lawrence again makes the storyline with the elephants- -crucial to the plot of the novel- -seem believable . my only complaint about this otherwise very moving book has to do with the writing at a crucial death scene near the end . i do want you to read this book , so i will try not to give anything away here , but the writing at this important point becomes formulaic in the dying character \\'s last words and even gomer

\\r\\n', \" made in 1959 , douglas sirk 's imitation of life is still just as evocative and as gorgeous to look today as it was almost 50 years ago . it 's a real cinematic treat , shameless tearjerker , and an unabashed melodrama that dares to confront head-on issues of racism and the problems of motherhood at the stage when one 's teenagers - in this case daughters- -are growing up and preparing to enter the world . lana turner has never looked more ravishing as lora meredith , a young new york widow who will do anything to realize her dreams of broadway stardom . together with her young daughter susie , they live in a squalid apartment eking out a hand-to-mouth existence , their futures fuelled by unfulfilled dreams . one day at coney island , lora and susie meet another a white girl sarah jane , who is being taken care of by a black woman , annie johnson ( juanita moore ) , whom lora mistakes for the maid . when told by her that she 's the mother , the surprised lora falters but then accepts it without a question as if it were a natural thing that a black woman has a white child . the angelic and virtuous annie asks lora if she can come and help out around the apartment . lora is initially hesitant - not because of annie 's race but because she 's struggling and does n't have any money to pay her a wage . eventually , however , she relents and tells annie that her and her daughter can stay for one night . at the same time , lora meets the extremely fine-looking wannabe photographer , steve archer ( john gavin ) . steve takes an instant liking to lora and offers to marry her . but lora is far too concerned with realizing her acting dreams to be stifled by a man and by marriage . meanwhile , the saintly annie is troubled that her daughter is ashamed of being black and tries to pass herself off in school as white . imitation of life follows these characters throughout their lives , with sirk piling on the sentiment and melodrama every chance he can get . lora does indeed become a famous broadway actress , yet neglects her growing daughter in the process . steve goes on to become a president of a large photographic organization , but has trouble relating to lora 's need to be independent and famous . annie 's heart is eventually broken , gradually worn down by years of emotional abuse from her daughter . sara jane is so angry at being labeled as black that she repudiates her mother and ultimately runs away . annie always stays the subservient and loyal maid ; whilst her best friend and employer goes on to bask in a lush and international success . the contrast of the mother 's compensations from their conflicting daughters is the story 's ultimate paradox . lora , annie , steve and the two girls seem to be victims of each other . they all want to follow their own dreams and forge their own paths in life even when it does n't seem to be doing them much good . they are also surprisingly oblivious of how manipulated they are by the world around them . lora gets her career but she 's unlucky in love and terminally insecure as a mother , whilst sara jane - perhaps the most damaged character - achieves her ambition to pass herself off as a white girl , but at great personal cost to both her and her aging mother . under douglas sirk 's accomplished direction , miss turner et al acts ornately and elaborately , everything is over emphasized to within an inch of its life , especially lana 's gorgeous outfits , yet the film - clocking in at over two hours - is always compelling and is never boring . the screenplay is sophisticated , the themes are brave and tempting and the look of the film - the brilliant surfaces , audacious colors , and the spatial complexities of 50s moderne architecture - bring to the forefront a bittersweet world of fantasy , entrapment , and emotional anxiety , and where the price of following one 's dreams eventually comes at a harsh and desultory cost . mike leonard june

( i would have bought the digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it did n't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane for a $1000 camera body ) . ) i do not recommend this lens or any of the g-series digital cameras from canon . when i 've got the money i 'll be buying the latest digital rebel and upgrading some of my old eos lenses , and selling my entire powershot kit . if you are an experienced photographer , you will not like this system at all \\r\\n\", \" it seems as if every time i want to use the camera , the battery is dead . i find that if i charge it and try to use it the next day , i should expect very much . i 'm going to purchase a new battery and see how that goes , but i should n't have to do so \\r\\n\", ' i bought the converter since i wanted to use it for landscape photography . i took some test shots and discovered that the converter has an unacceptable amount of barrel distorion . if you are thinking about buying this product just be aware that you will have to correct your images through software after you take them \\r\\n', \" bought these for my nikon d200 about 3 months ago . never having used tiffen before i took a chance on a recommendation . vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse i 've seen . build quality of all the filters is really not very good . going to go back to hoya 's which are much better \\r\\n\", \" i 'm a huge orson welles fan and actually regret making this public knowledge - but i hated this film . i was excited to crack open the beautiful packaging and quickly fell into a disappointing episode of feeling really dumb that i just did n't get it . the photography was classic welles - the acting was something out of a bad rehersal at an insane asylum . do n't get caught up in having to like it , just because it 's welles - it 's ok to go against the grain and declare to the world - this movie blows \\r\\n\", ' in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts , the d70s has fallen behind the pack . ( however , if that \\'s the only measure by which you \\'re judging a digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it \\'s quite a good camera . what i like about it most : - it looks and feels solid . some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars . it \\'s not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over , but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it \\'s category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility with decade \\'s worth of nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - the latch that keeps the pop-up flash in place broke in less than a week . - inability to meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb-600 and sb-800. - nikon \\'s raw software and control software are n\\'t included with the camera , and are imho overpriced . ( ...and on top of that , nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages.. . ) what would improve this camera the most : - iso 100 and iso 3200+ - ability to store multiple custom white balance presets , and then pull them up on the fly . - replacing the \" idiot modes \" ( i.e. \" portrait \" , \" landscape \" , etc. ) with modes that you could customize \\r\\n', \" i used paint shop pro to help build my website . i really like it and i 'm glad i bought it . my favorite part about it is the animation software . you can do great animation or cool banners or even little buttons with cool effects . because of psp 9 my website now has animation , buttons and a banner with bright colors and images ! i love it ! and anyone can use it ! i had no experience with psp or computer art and graphics , but this is pretty simple to use . also you can use psp for touching up and doing other neat things with your photographs . this is great software for doing all this stuff and it 's so much cheaper than photoshop . if you 're building a website and want to add color and graphics or if you want do to some photo touch up work , then maybe you want to check out paint shop pro \\r\\n\", ' learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 2 , continues where the first cd left off . like the first cd , this program may take some guessing regarding what exactly is one supposed to do , and clicking on the crown in the upper right corner helps to navigate through the game . this program is really good for grasping the basic tactics and strategies because your progress is measured and you have to develop certain skill proficiency before moving to higher level and learning more tactics and strategies . the cd covers some popular opening moves , middle game tactics like pins , forks , skewers and deflection , and mating strategies in end game . with practice on this cd , you can begin to win some games , and then move on to learn to play chess with fritz and chesster 3 , which is out in german , and is supposed to be out soon in english \\r\\n', \" the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand . some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera 's randomly broke after about 1 year and i did not drop the camera ( just like another reviewer ) . i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd - randomly broke - has a crack across the lcd . of course , sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda - after 1 month ? since the camera was out of warranty , i knew there was nothing they were going to do . so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it - go for it ! but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products , look elsewhere . i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc. i am not buying anymore sony products - i have lost the love for sony and their products ! beware ! canon , here i come ! \\r\\n\", \" great speeches by native americans is the model of simplicity . though edited by bob blaisdell , who presumably provides the single-paragraph introductions , the bulk of the book is simply the spoken words of native americans from the time of first contact in north america to the present day . their messages speak for themselves . a number of themes and characteristics run through these selections . one is their brevity . the speakers get to the point and make it clearly . few inclusions run longer than five pages . there is also a level of genuine ( and often sad ) honesty . many selections concern the loss of tribal lands and the american indians ' efforts to hold onto them or gain just compensation , if such a thing was possible at the time . the tone is often one of resignation , but also of appeal to the better nature of their listeners . it is not possible to say if these speeches were carefully selected for this editorial theme or not , but it appears that for several centuries the native peoples viewed , rightly or wrongly , the european and later american entry into the continent as something that words and argument and demonstrated moral behavior could combat . even among the surrender speeches of various tribal chiefs we see the notion that no speaker could really understand what their people could have done differently to avoid such conflicts . the style could almost be considered anti-oratorical , though the simple approach is here elevated to a style of its own . one should probably consider that many of these speeches are translated into english . nonetheless , the organization of thought and prioritization of points shows a group of people , separated by years , language , and geography who retain a clear-headed means of addressing their listeners \\r\\n\", ' i found the same problem that other users of this product experienced . particularly the issue of the shutter release being at the bottom of the camera when composing a portrait oriented shot . i found a stroboframe flash bracket that rotates the camera counter clockwise within the flash bracket instead of flipping the flash . this leaves the shutter release at the top of the camera and also alleviated the other problem of speed light hot shoe breakage from repeated \" flipping \" of the flash that some other users have reported . the item is manufactured by stroboframe and can be found at an ebay store called \" gadget infinity \" under the listing title of \" flash bracket with 90 degrees camera rotate feature \" . buy it now price is $29.99. i just bought one and it arrived yesterday and i could not be happier . pass the word of this ingenious new product that will solve the issues that have plagued photographers for the past several years \\r\\n', ' so , why give justice league the full 5 stars ? because it appeals to every generation in my family . i bought this for my 4 year old son who is enamored with superheros . as we hung out together watching the shows , i was as engrossed in the story as my son . then i noticed that my wife was intrigued ; and so were the grandparents ! the characters and plots are very well developed for a \" cartoon \" , so it is more like watching a dramatic series . watching the series allows you to pick up on sub-plots too ; like the attraction between batman and wonderwoman - jean jone \\'s struggle to find a place as the last of his people - and the entire groups struggle to work together as a cohesive team . another excellent buy to consider would be the spiderman the new animated series \\r\\n', ' i liked very much these series . you will enjoy every momets in this moives . it is deserve a place in my collection \\r\\n', ' are you looking for a way to get your kids into the kitchen , turing out tasty projects ? i know i was- -and i went through about fifteen \" kids \" cookbooks at the local bookstore before i stumbled on this little gem . it was the only cookbook ( other than the everything kid \\'s cookbooks ) that would actually get a child into the kitchen . the projects are appealing on all levels- -they are easy to assemble , they are too cute for words , and they have super easy to follow pictoral instructions . it also has a good balance of entrees to deserts , unlike some of the family cookbooks i \\'ve reviewed . and with the desserts- -like cookies- -it takes one basic recipe and shows you about four different ways to use it- -marvelous ! it \\'s also pantry friendly- -no star fruit or rare ingredients you do n\\'t have laying around . now if you \\'re looking for a kids cookbook to vary your family \\'s fare , then keep in mind this is a slender picture-book sized volume- -you wo n\\'t find more than 22 projects in the whole book . for a good standard family cookbook , i recommmend beyond mac \\' n \\' cheese by mops . but if you are looking to get your kids ( 12 and under ) into the kitchen to spend some time together having fun at the counter , then do n\\'t hesitate to buy this little gem ! it is my number one recommendation for children \\'s cookbook , project-wise . for the above twelve set , i recommend the everything kid \\'s cookbook because it is a little more geared towards meals and has crossword puzzles and fun foods that are meant to be played with . if you are looking for a cookbook with tons of recipes that will appeal to your family , be pantry friendly *and* save you money , check out \" cheap . fast . good . \" \\r\\n', ' i think the shaver works well , but the plastic is thin and cheap . the biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor , cleaning brush and charger . i think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case \\r\\n', ' beautiful voice , but so much anger in the lyrics ruins the cd . i was offended just reading every name on this cd...it is really a shame , what pretty \" vulgar \" voice . if this cd sells millions will you be proud of the message of hate you just pushed into millions of ears . you should be ashamed of yourself as an artist , as you have such power , but it is spent on prepetuating hate . nina simone was a angry artist also , but not once did she offend me ( caucasian male ) with her lyrics and all of her hate for racism in america . the first song i ever heard of hers \" mississippi goddam \" made me cry , so emotionally charged and commanding of a voice . there will always be a \" racist america \" because people are selfish , but be responsible as a descent human being and as an artist . i liked the cd until i heard the lyrics , one less sale adds up after awhile \\r\\n', ' with plenty of opportunity to be creative . the only downfall is that there is no way to download more cards from the internet . all in all though , i would highly recommend this software \\r\\n', \" before i review , i 'd like to clear something up : i am a very latecomer in seeing this movie . i was introduced to the ghost in the shell franchise through the new anime series airing on adult swim , ghost in the shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love that show , and so i figured eventually i 'd have to get around to seeing the movie , which i knew full well shares no connection with the show . they 're both seperate interperetations of the comic series of the same name , ( which i have not read , so i do n't know which is more accurate ) but the tv series is exponentially better than this movie in almost every concievable way . there are many things i do n't like about this movie , the biggest being poor pacing . the plot for the movie is actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all the filler , but that 's the biggest problem . there 's not really enough story to last a full-length feature , because it seems almost like it was originally written with the intention of being a 30 minute short . and since they did n't have the budget to load the movie up with action scenes ( there are barely any , and they are n't very impressive for the most part ) they had to slow the story down with drawn out conversations that you wo n't understand more than 60% of , and camera shots that last for what feels like minutes where we 're looking at either nothing , or a woman 's nipples . that 's not cinematic artistry , that 's being either lazy or perverted . the animation itself is n't even that good , especially considering that this is was a theatrical release from only 10 years ago . it 's choppy , and there 's not really a whole lot of detail ( except when it comes to women 's nipples ) . looking at just the animation , if i did n't know better , i 'd have thought this movie was an ova from the 1980's . the only thing i can really say i liked about this movie was that it was ghost in the shell . it 's probably kind of like how i did n't see the 1989 batman movie until years after i 'd been spoiled by batman the animated series , and could n't bring myself to like it for any reason other than that it was batman . everything about the tv series is superior to this movie : the animation , the stories , the character developement , the production values.. . i could go on for an entire page about how much better the tv series is . in short , if you 're you 're at all interested in the gits franchise , do yourself a favor and rent the dvds of the tv show instead . you 'll find a lot to love , but i ca n't say the same about the movie . my dream is that someday alex proyas will give us a gits movie that lives up to what i would hope for after watching standalone complex \\r\\n\", \" this is a fascinating read and my favorite of all bacon 's writings \\r\\n\", \" i was completely fooled . twice . my fiancee had told me she was getting me socks and underwear for christmas . so as i slowly open the box , i see a pair of socks on top . there was more underneath , so i start opening it further and there is a camera case , a memory card and then finally at the bottom of the box , the hp photosmart m525 digital camera ! i was overjoyed at finally getting a digital camera of my own . no more borrowing from my sister when i needed to snap a few pictures . i put the memory card and batteries in and began taking some pictures . to put it bluntly , ugh ! ! ! the first thing that i noticed is that , even in best picture mode , the pictures were a little blurry / grainy even in the best of lighting conditions . the second thing that i noticed is that the pictures are distorted . there 's a slight fisheye effect ( imagine looking through a peep-hole on a door . ) which is quite annoying . i talked to hp support ( someone who spoke very poor english i might add . what is the deal with that ? ) and after about 45 minutes of discussion it was determined that the easiest thing for me to do was to go back to the store and exchange it for the same model . guess what ? same problem ! so after talking to hp once again , i am returning this one and getting a different brand . this is a horrible product . my sisters kodak that i bought 3 years ago is a far superior product . i am very disappointed . hp needs to put out a better product , and have some customer support reps that speak better english . it gets frustrating repeating yourself over and over again to be understood \\r\\n\", \" this writting instrument is superb in it 's ability to compensate the energetic writer \\r\\n\", ' ms office student and teacher edition 2003 is a versatile tool you can use for different purposes : office documents and presentations , school work and projects , correspondences , scrapbooks , pictures , etc. truly a great addition to your computer software \\r\\n', \" let 's learn kanji is systematic , it gives you a wealth of basic kanji knowledge ( including stroke order and radicals ) as well as providing space to practice and regular worksheets / mini tests so you can monitor your progress !

beeps , then press the button for a second cycle ) every few hours as long as the bump is detectable in any way . you may get very slight burning of your skin ( causing a whitish film or slight peeling ) and you may go through your cartridge tips quickly , but believe me , it 's worth it to avoid the horrible months-long process of cystic acne . i am using this in conjunction with a very thorough natural skincare regime and improved nutrition , and seeing the results i have hoped for after 2 weeks \\r\\n\", ' i received one of these towels as a gift several years ago . it was , by far

same . make no mistake about it - this is concentrated & comes out like heinz ketchup : it does seem to be concentrated , and we did notice a certain amount of difficulty getting the detergent out of the bottle , kind of reminded us of heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? the standard strength product is clearly a 5-star product , however owing to the fact that this product does not work as well without adding more detergent than the direction claim , it rates 4-stars with our family . trying to learn objective info on laundry detergent is well . . . . the following is true of this product in standard strength or 3x with extra detergent added : i am allergic to most laundry detergents , but this product has prevented severe discomfort for me for about 10 years . it is consistently among the lowest-priced detergents available . in addition to being very easy on clothes and skin , it does work quite well in the stain-removal department and can be used as its own presoak . this is good to know if you are like me and are trying to avoid allergens . it is important to remember that if you buy a hypoallergenic powder detergent instead of a liquid like this , you may have to pre-soak stains and you wo n\\'t have a hypoallergenic liquid with which to do it . while \" tide \" and \" cheer \" are also available in hypoallergenic formulas , [ \" tide free \" is actually just unscented] they are considerably more expensive and work no better in my experience . that \\'s why i like this \" all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent \" . objective information is tough to find ! i actually did conduct a hard target search for true , objective information on laundry detergents . there is very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , is not what i was trying to find . \" consumer reports \" does have test comparisons of the most popular brands in its monthly magazine every couple of years and they do include some detail . about \" all \\'s website \" if you are looking for this product \\'s website it is under \" unilever \" and you will have to specify \" usa \" under products , as the word \" all \" will

1990 debut , every song on it was so incredibly generic , there was no hope for this band . the whole album seemed rushed and thrown together . they had nothing meaningful to say with these songs , it just seemed like they were pumping out filler and hoping somebody would be stupid enough to fall for their \" supergroup \" scam . the big , booming , arena rock choruses just ring hollow . i guess they \\'re trying to be catchy and have memorable hooks , but to me , it just sounds like a lot of filler . supergroups will always suck , because they diliberately try to sound bad ! thats right

\\'re already popular , so people will buy it no matter how bad it is ! lets just put out filler . \" supergroups are a total farce , its just easy money for the people involved , and nothing more .

anything by damn yankees , or any other supergroup \\r\\n', \" i 'll put my opinion first , so there wo n't be any doubt in your mind . i do n't believe that you can write useful books about national character . is there really such a thing as & quot ; national character&quot ; ? people are just too different , too unpredictable . how well can you predict the behavior of the people closest to you ? how well can you predict what people in your own country will do ? would every italian , if they could write well , have written the same book as mr. barzini ? i seriously doubt it . so what we have in the italians is one man 's views on the conglomerate nature of 50 million italians . after reading it , i felt even more strongly that such books , though possibly entertaining , are a waste of time . an informative book about unicorns- -but do they exist ? anthropologists have been concerned , for many years , in getting the & quot ; inside view&quot ; - -the view of a culture as seen by the person within it . while barzini is indisputable italian , he tries to visualize italians as seen by foreign visitors , then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there , why they are as visitors see them , or why they are not as foreigners may think . this is not a successful gambit . cultures are based on many general factors- -like history , socio-economic patterns , religion , family , etc.- --but the specific results are just that , specific . barzini covers many topics- -the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of something rather than actually having that quality ; the family vs. the state ; italian modes of achieving success ; the north-south split ; sicily and the mafia ; and last , the tragedy of italy 's long domination by foreigners . but nothing really connects . there are only superficial , scattered impressions , nothing very concrete to grasp . the reader is left with a handful of stereotypes . barzini is at his best when describing the lives and modus operandi of particular characters in italian history . these sections were well-written and interesting . but his portrayal of italian & quot ; character&quot ; is fuzzy , contradictory , and ultimately , unconvincing . finally , if you are a lover of lists , you will thrill to this book , because there is a list on nearly every single page . myself , i got pretty tired of those lists . if you want to know something useful about italy , read another book . if you just want entertainment , which might support any stereotypes you have about italians , then this book could be for you \\r\\n\", ' to be or not to be is a comedy set during wwii . although it makes light of a tense time in history , it manages to maintain an air of respect and mischief to keep the viewer at ease . the story revolves around two actors in poland , maria and joseph tura . joseph ( jack benny ) specializes in overplaying hamlet and maria ( carole lombard ) specializes in seducing younger men in her dressing room as her husband begins his \" to be or not to be \" speech . the man she seduces is a soldier who draws her into a dangerous spy situation . although she is working for the allies , a nazi leader attempts to make her a spy for his cause . madcap comedy ensues as the actors attempt to get them out of the mess . the film is very funny thanks to the brilliant dialogue

though i usually go in for tough police thrillers , i sometimes mix things up by reading a light , funny mystery or - like this book - a quiet , thoughtful mystery set in a small town ( a \" cozy \" ,

much no violence - with a little modernity , in the form of occasional well-placed profanity ( though not much ) and modern demographics ( a gay couple is included among the main characters ) . the main detective character , intelligent and interesting , owes a little to christie \\'s hercule poirot , but not everything . the mystery itself is pretty interesting , too , though some aspects of

- much less cutting edge . it \\'s true that jimi does some respectable work on this record against the backdrop of the blues grooves supplied for him , but there \\'s an odd and unwelcome shift in the balance . buddy miles became a kind of intrusion into the world jimi had fashioned in his previous work . on a hendrix album , songs sung by buddy miles did n\\'t move the bar ; they did not elucidate jimi \\'s universe . buddy \\'s drum work was simply not in the style of mitch mitchell , and that was a large step down from the experience \\'s innovative grooves in songs like \" fire , \" for example . listen to \" fire , \" and then listen to any cut on \" band of gypsys . \" listen to hendrix \\'s wild half-sung , half-wailed vocals on the previous albums , and then listen to buddy miles sing \" changes . \" you ca n\\'t reconcile the two styles , and that would not be quite so bad if it were n\\'t for the obvious fact that band of gypsys , under buddy miles \\' unfortunate influence , were not a step backward toward traditional blues rather than another reach into the future already painted by jimi \\'s previous work in tracks like \" are you experienced ? \" and \" third stone from the sun . \" jimi \\'s guitar work put him several steps ahead of the blues in terms of making his instrument perform overdriven rock tone poems and distorted rock concertos on his behalf . band of gypsys turned jimi backward into a lead player in a blues band , which one might even have mistaken as being headed up by sideman buddy miles . that \\'s not what people bought a hendrix album for . it just did n\\'t work very well as a release from what people still considered the hendrix experience . jimi seemed to have gone off track somehow , and the effect was to make him seem a little less what he had been up to that point . no doubt people got smoked up and enjoyed portions of the album that seemed like an intimate studio groove , but the cohesion of the experience , the clear creative identity of the hendrix experience was not there . you can say it was as simple as the fact that we missed noel redding and mitch mitchell , and that may be true . but whatever the line-up , people were not entirely ready for jimi to share his stage with any other would-be featured players . \\r\\n', ' look , the fact is feminism is about choice no more , no less . i have the highest respect for stay at home moms- -it is the hardest darn job on earth . but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie . feminism gave us a choice . it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls . personally , i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species . i work with troubled teens , my skills do not go to waste , i spoil my nieces and nephews- -i am fulfilled and happy . my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys , she is fulfilled and happy , feminism gave us those choices , ladies . we were not \" sold \" anything , we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us . if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world \\'s most important job , i think that is your issue and not now\\'s . stop blaming feminism for your insecurities , if you are feminist- -stop blaming your mother for your insecurities- -you have choices because of feminism not despite it ! \\r\\n', ' i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years . this new model er430k is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement . it \\'s nice and quiet , and i \\'m sure the vacuum works great , but i would n\\'t know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim . we \\'re talking about hairs easily 1 / 4 \" in length . a trimmer should be able to shave those down , do n\\'t you think ? if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors . do n\\'t bother even trying this product , it \\'s a waste of money \\r\\n', ' i tried the trick of resizing , but honestly , the image quality is still abyssmal . the images are so low-resolution that only the vaguest of detail comes out . please , if you \\'re thinking of buying this for someone for christmas this year , choose something else . it might be okay for someone with low standards or poor eyesight , but for anyone who can see well and knows what a good digital image looks like , this will be a huge disappointment . the good news is that in a few years these digital keychains will have advanced and will offer much better performance -

feel his elation and his grief , and if he died a spear of love would fly back across the world to pierce her waiting omniscient heart . it would be the same for him . in the midst of desert \\'s fire

, which really caught my eye . \" one does n\\'t know the questions of life until one is asked \" another thing i noticed about the book is that the central character , shalimar , is seldom mentioned . the book seems to hover around other dozen characters . only in prison and in that one letter sent back to kashmira does shalimar \\'s true character really come out . the second quarter of the book got immensely boring and i really despise how max \\'s character was written about . it was annoying , difficult to read , over-detailed and excruciating to read . boonyi was an outstanding character . so was the old witch and boonyi \\'s father . when colonel tortoise was mentioned in the book , i thought his character would prove of some consequence but nothing about yielded anything . one could n\\'t help but dislike max \\'s lack of integrity . mythology is rather well written about in this book . every 50 pages , a one page something would be mentioned including just the right amount of detail and words . conclusion - while reading , time and again i would rage on to my friend about how superb the writer \\'s grasp on the reader is . the writer knows his words , where to use them , he knows that he has a prodigious way of writing and he employed them better than ever . maybe this book disappointed his core fans . maybe it lacked a spark enough to obilerate doubt . all in all , i

that , and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , and so on . one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most-likely-to-use to least-likely , so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera . i \\'ve gotten some nice pictures with this , with and without flash . a nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i \\'ve also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices , although for the price this camera is

installation ran smoothly . liveupdate ran automatically and updated the product without a hitch . norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses , it detects spyware and rootkits as well . it has an inbound firewall , and apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities . it does not protect against phishing , identity theft , or spam , nor does it contain full outbound firewall protection . when installed on windows vista , norton antivirus takes over for windows defender and the windows firewall . i did not expect the latter ; symantec should have made it more clear that this product includes a software firewall . norton antivirus integrates well with windows security center . norton antivirus 2007 is noticeably quicker both in normal operation and during full scans than previous versions . norton antivirus has always performed well in industry comparisons against other antivirus products . the only other product that i would use myself is mcafee virusscan , but i have always felt that norton antivirus does a more aggressive job of protecting my system . for those of you installing norton antivirus 2007 as an upgrade , i would highly recommend that you first remove any existing norton security products using add / remove programs in the control panel . then , download and run the norton removal tool from the symantec site to make sure that it \\'s all gone . to see

isaiah effect , \" might undoubtedly be drawn to the implications of the title : that there exists some mystical , unifying code which is only now being fully understood through modern techniques , research , and understanding . i , as one such browser , had briefly read about the so-called \" bible code \" which computers have now enabled man to explore and thought that the subject of this book might be related . with my interest piqued at the title and the book description , i delved into the pages expecting to learn exactly what encompassed isaiah \\'s \" precise instructions \" of prayer . i wanted to know exactly what braden claimed to have stumbled upon . what i found in this 250 page foray into countless subjects was nothing other than a pastiche of new-thought concepts . the mixing of religions , for example - a sort of pick-and-choose spirituality which has slowly been creeping its way into the mainstream for decades - is recycled over and over again , drawing from endless sources of gnostic gospels and other lost books . in only one chapter does braden actually begin to describe in detail verses from the book of isaiah . instead he relegates the books of the essenes to positions of higher authority and prominence . in the brief pages in which braden actually does discuss isaiah , his conclusions speak nothing of a decoded lost science . his basic premise of \" the effect \" is that people can alter their futures by the choices they make in the present . such a revelation is not a new interpretation of isaiah at all . any student of the bible and christianity knows that all the prophetic books of the old testament are records of god warning israel , and the world , of turning away from him . to braden \\'s credit , his discussions of the effects of prayer in today \\'s society are commemorable , albeit somewhat misguided . i agree with him that people in today \\'s society need to turn away from the petty details of life with which they \\'ve surrounded themselves . however , i believe braden over-emphasizes the role of feelings and emotion in prayer . he fails to discuss how humans , and their emotions , are extremly fallable and can change as quickly as the winds in his anecdotes . braden wants desperately to believe that the true power of prayer is to be found in all the lost science which he has uncovered in ancient texts . in the process he fails to recognize that the blueprint for prayer has been known to man ever since he was created . humbleness before god and the filling of the holy spirit are the true keys to prayer - not cosmic emotions and human feelings . a disappointing read \\r\\n', \" the people who have mentioned aphex twin and four tet have clearly never listened to either of these artists . if

label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy . i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross-contamination from some other process . in either case , vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product . the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts . this bar also contains 20% of the daily recommended dietary fiber , which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar . there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements , which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements , in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing . clif bars could be a casual snack ,

at its basic level it is an attempt to detect a live system and then identify the computing environment , services , applications , and vulnerabilities on that system . basically there are two types of assessment - internal and external . an internal assessment is done over the local network and external is done from outside the lan . nessus will do both types and the book details how to do either , or both of them . the authors do an excellent job of detailing installation , setup , and how to interpret the results of a scan as well as various factors that can affect the report . one of the parts not to be missed is the discussion of not only the benefits but also the potential problems of scanning your system . some of the vulnerability types scanned for include buffer overflows , default passwords , backdoors , information leaks , and denial of service . the nessus scripting language is covered in detail in appendix a instead of the main portion of the book ; a choice i appreciated very much as it allowed the flow of the book to not be interrupted by such a highly technical section . with open source products there generally is no organized technical support phone number you can call of help . so , the authors include information on how to get help via the nessus user community , mailing lists , and archives . nessus network auditing is a highly recommended book for anyone interested in auditing their network to find potential problems before they become reality \\r\\n', ' asks the interviewer , \" what place would you give shoot the piano player in relation to your other films ? \" answers director françois truffaut , \" no place . simply the second film i made . \" considering his first feature film was the four hundred blows and his third was jules et jim , truffaut \\'s matter-of-factness and lack of pretense is worth a smile . shoot the piano player is worth smiles , too . it \\'s a clever film , playful at times , even funny . more than anything , however , it defies categorization . the movie is a strange and successful amalgamation of crime and comedy , suspense and inevitability , tragedy and love , and gangsters , girl friends and violence . it \\'s the story of charlie koller ( charles aznavour ) , a piano player in a paris dive , who used to be eduoard saroyan , a famous pianist , whose wife committed suicide . truffaut says the movie is a film about a shy man . charlie is the kind of shy man who cannot bring himself to touch the hand of a woman he wants . he ca n\\'t go back and open the door to the room where he left his wife sobbing . he thinks about what he should do , but ca n\\'t do it , and then circumstances take over . charlie , thanks to his brothers , finds himself in a gangland underworld where double-crossing is going to lead to a shootout in the snow . some say shoot the piano player is an homage to american gangster films . perhaps it is , but i challenge anyone to spend much time considering this possibility while watching the movie . the film is original , funny , moving and sad . it \\'s the kind of film that people who love movies write essays about . all i know is that i was moved by charlie . we leave him where we met him , playing piano in a paris dive . charles aznavour , a diminutive man with a hangdog look , plays charlie perfectly . aznavour is probably better known in the u. s . as a singer , but in france he \\'s seen as both an actor and a singer . he \\'s a minimalist , he says about himself . charlie thinks too much and does too little . aznavour lets us see into charlie \\'s soul with few words . it \\'s a marvelous performance that left me saddened by charlie , but liking him . the criterion dvd transfer is first-rate . criterion gives us two discs . the first has the movie and a commentary track . the second disc contains interviews by aznavour and marie dubois , who played charlie \\'s girlfriend , lena , plus excerpts from documentaries featuring truffaut , and other extras . the criterion case contains a 28 page booklet with substantial material on the film and truffaut \\r\\n', ' ray sawyer ( rick cramer ) , agnes bruckner ( eden ) , laura ramsey ( rachel ) , jonathan jackson ( eric ) , and d.j. cotrana ( sean ) star in this scary and bloody slasher movie . eric and eden are going through any typical teen romance ; going steady one minute , broken up the next . eden works at a local truck stop as a waitress . one evening , ray pulls into the truck stop to get some food . known as the local nut case , ray has few friends and owns a filling station on the edge of town . later that same evening , ray comes upon eric and eden on a lonely bridge . swerving to miss eric \\'s jeep , ray instead crashes into an on-coming car . the impact of the crash sends the car slamming through the guardrail of the bridge . the car is now teetering precariously on the side of the bridge . ray jumps from his truck and goes to the aid of the woman inside the car . after pulling her to safety , ray goes back inside to retrieve a suitcase that the woman told him about . however , both ray and the car tumble over the side of the bridge and into the water below . to make matters worse , the suitcase is full of poisonous snakes , who immediately begin striking at ray . all that can be heard are ray \\'s screams as the car sinks . ray \\'s body is pulled from the water and taken to the local morgue . but it does n\\'t remain there for long . it seems that the woman in the car was a voodoo priestess , and the snakes were used to \" cleanse \" people by drawing the evil out of them . now , the evil venom is flowing through ray . now begins a bloodbath of carnage as ray , possessed by the power of the evil venom flowing through him , begins to stalk unsuspecting victims . one by one , he exacts his revenge on eden \\'s friends until only eden remains . who will win this final showdown ; ray or eden ? i \\'ve always been a big fan of slasher-type films , and characters like freddy from the \" nightmare on elm street \" series , as well as jason from \" friday the 13th \" . ray sawyer fits the mold of the typical slasher perfectly . the motives are the same ; kill as many teenagers as possible , and ray succeeds in this very well . i thought the story involving voodoo was well-conceived . the special effects were good , too . i recommend this movie to horror and slasher fans . although the movie is short ( only about 80 minutes ) , there \\'s lots of slashing in a short amount of time . if you enjoy a good slasher flick , then do n\\'t miss \" venom \" . \\r\\n', ' murky : in his book , 1984 , orwell described a contrived language he called \" newspeak \" , designed to render politically incorrect ideas inexpressible . but before orwell there were russell and whitehead , who contrived a symbolic logic that distorts ideas they deemed philosophically incorrect by combining logical quantification with expression of existence . as whitehead wrote in his \" foreword \" to quine \\'s ph.d . dissertation titled a system of logic : logic shapes metaphysical thought . thus in his \" on universals \" quine argued that in the russellian logic realism must be expressed by quantifying over predicates so they reference universals as \" entities \" . and he co-authored with goodman \" steps toward a constructive nominalism \" , a nominalist manifesto , in which all philosophers are classified as either nominalists or \" platonists \" depending on whether or not predicates are quantified so they reference entities . i believe that anyone who says that universals are \" referenced \" or who uses the phrase \" abstract entities \" fully deserves to be labeled a platonist . but loux uses the rhetoric from the russellian nominalist newspeak . in the \" search inside this book \" screens at this amazon web site the reader will find him reporting ( p . 20 ) that realists say universals are shared \" entities \" and are \" referents \" of predicates . i ask loux : what happened to signification ? the symbolic logician alonzo church recognized sense ( i.e. signification ) as well as denotation ( i.e. reference ) in the functional ( i.e. predicate ) calculus . i ask loux : what happened to supposition , which distinguishes reference from signification ? in his book titled meaning and necessity rudolf carnap explicitly affirms that intensions ( i.e. significations ) may be said to be objective without invoking any hypostatization ( i.e. reference ) , and are indifferent to either concrete or abstract objects . i ask loux : since the demise of logical positivism does the russellian predicate calculus have any applications in philosophy or anywhere else ? is loux trying to appear contemporary with the russellian rhetoric ? i see murky writing . muddled : loux is sympathetic to aristotle and unsympathetic to quine , the pragmatic realist , who rejects first philosophies with their prejudicial ontological criteria for scientific criticism , and who affirms ontological relativity in which ontological commitment is subordinated to empirical testing . ontological relativity started as an analogy : quine relativized ontology as einstein relativized time . einstein posited relativistic time as real time instead of newton \\'s absolute time , and he rejected lorentz \\'s making relativistic time apparent time . likewise heisenberg invoked this einstein precedent for his own realistic copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory \\'s positing of duality and indeterminacy . today physicists describe reality in terms of superposition , nonlocality and calabi-yau spaces in eleven dimensions . quine generalized beyond physics to our global web of beliefs . realism is a natural , primordial , irrepressible prejudice motivated by disappointments in our beliefs including falsifications of our scientific theories . on the other hand ontology is anything but natural or primordial . it is an elaborately complex linguistic artifact that evolves and that has a cultural history . it is reality as cognitively captured by the artifactual semantics of language expressing our accepted general beliefs including our tested and currently nonfalsified scientific theories . but in notre dame journal of formal logic and in this book loux rejects ontological relativity , and he calls philosophies using ontological relativity \" anti-realism \" . in fact ontological relativity and relativized semantics do not oppose realism , but rather they enable it in this age of scientific change . i do not find this book contemporary . loux \\'s \" realism - anti-realism \" locution is a false dichotomy . i see muddled thinking . marginalized : while a student i found notre dame \\'s philosophy faculty unsympathetic to contemporary pragmatism and its scientific realism . when i left their graduate school of philosophy i took with me the opinion that their academic culture is a marginalized backwater preferring to protect the past rather than forge the future with new thinking . i see in this book a textbook in notre dame metaphysics for notre dame philosophy students . readers who are cognizant of the influence of modern science on philosophy - notably how quantum theory occasioned the emergence and ascendancy of contemporary pragmatism - are likely to be more critical of this book than other reviewers at this amazon site . thomas j . hicke \\r\\n', ' this is a great productbecause once you install ityou need not use the cd agai \\r\\n', ' well i \\'ll explain that later . she uses her own vocals . she does n\\'t even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.i love how the editoral review uses the term \" unique vocal talent \" . yoko has no vocal talents . i must also point out i am courtney love \\'s number one fan , so this should give me even more cred . it just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she wo n\\'t let other artists do an album using their own vox . she loves the sound of her own too much ! i already went through that stage where i made everyone listen her as a joke . i was about 14 then . my point here , this is n\\'t even a good joke . its just dumb . i listened to the song clips provided on amazon . even that was too much . if you must , just download this album for free . do not buy it . do not in any way support this woman . i wish there was a zero star rating . \\r\\n', \" the stationery is cute and colorful , but the pages are very cluttered . while the envelopes have spaces to write addresses and put return labels , the pages are too colorful and bold . a ballpoint or ink pen does n't look good on the paper . \\r\\n\", ' this hair dryer did dry my hair quickly . but , it quit working after a month . i exchanged it for another just like it and the same thing happened a few weeks later . the buttons were also hard to switch . this was a waste of money . i ended up buying a completely different hair dryer \\r\\n', \" this cd is 100% pure junk ! the cd is sung by kids ! they have high-pitched voices that are n't even good enough to win the school talent show . the other singers are adults who have voices that are n't anything impressive , either . if the songs were sung by the original singer it would of been better . stop this s****y music ! \\r\\n\", \" the black of this is the same as on my camera , and with all the parts together , this is one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare / reflection , as i have not used it on a sunny day , but i do n't see why it shouldn't . and as cheap as this little product is , it is pretty much a must have with this camera !

' he shakes his head to bring himself out of his daze and says ` of course ' , then repairs to the adjoining bedroom , where he lies down on the bed to have a smoke , allowing her to conduct her bath in privacy . a moment later , he hears a noise and looks up to see stella emerge from the bathroom , completely naked , in a full-frontal nude shot . moreau gets up from the bed and lifts the covers , suggesting that she warm herself . she climbs into the bed ; he covers her up , and steps away to the other side of the room . there is nothing about the scene that implies that anything improper occurred . he has simply offered her care and comfort and sympathy . this shot only lasts a few seconds , but i feel that , regardless of the director 's reasoning for shooting it in the first place , it could have been left out . if the point was to show that moreau has either had morals all along , or that he has acquired them , it could have been demonstrated in a variety of other ways . earlier in the film , stella had witnessed one of her caregivers , semi-nude , in moreau 's hotel room ( stella saw this from outside ) . given her ` schoolgirl crush ' on moreau , it seemed natural for her to become upset over this . as a result , however , the scene after the bath comes across as a young girl inappropriately mimicking adult sexual behaviour . this , combined with the ` adult ' voice dubbed over stella 's , makes the scene even more disquieting . there are some viewers who might argue that , in europe , ` standards ' involving nudity and sexuality are not as reactionary as those in the us . in many instances , i would wholeheartedly agree with them . there is much hypocrisy in the dynamics of american culture and moral values , and not a little bit of neurosis . however , the sexual objectification of children is something about which i feel very strongly...and i think the scene in question in this film amounts to exactly that . do n't get me wrong - - i 'm not so prudish that i turn away from even full-frontal nudity in a film , if it 's not gratuitous and it 's an integral part of the storyline...but here , it involves a prepubescent girl , and could have easily been left out . it worries me bit that this point has not been made by other reviewers . have we become so numbed in respect to nudity in films that many ca n't recognize an instance where it 's not only unnecessary , but potentially harmful ? i 'm glad i 've seen the film - - and i 'd recommend it with a bit of praise and some strong reservations , as noted above . with all of the ridiculous claims from some quarters that the holocaust never happened , i think it 's vitally important for films on the subject to be made and seen . the czech film all my loved ones is an excellent film about this horrible time that has not gotten the attention it deserves - - seek it out . n.b. - - this is the second time i have posted this exact review . i noticed today ( 6 april 2006 ) that it has , for some reason , been removed from the site . i 've re-read what i 've written , and i do n't see anything objectionable or offensive . the issues i have with the film are discussed straightforwardly . if anyone objects to anything i 've written here , i 'd like to know what it is . \\r\\n\", ' eugene o\\'neill \\'s play \" long day \\'s journey into night \" is a pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play about his family . i must admit that though eugene o\\'neill is considered by some to be the father of american theater , i did not enjoy reading this play . the tyrone family \\'s insane dysfunction with their constant bickering and apologizing was very annoying and frustrating to read . i also disliked the fact that after four acts of continuous yelling and tension o\\'neill offered no conclusion . the day in the life of the tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks and the play just ends . no happy ending , no hope for the future , just despair . \" long day \\'s journey into night \" is a wholly depressing read that i really could have done without . however , after learning more about eugene o\\'neill \\'s background , and the extent to which the play is based on his life , i began to have a greater appreciation for this play . o\\'neill did lead a very hard life , therefore the frustration and despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o\\'neill \\'s talent to engage his audience and to convey the emotions of the characters in a very real manner . while o\\'neill \\'s depressing end did not satisfy my craving for a happy ending , it was appropriate for the play as eugene \\'s own family never got a happy ending . i did like the clever way o\\'neill showed the tyrone family \\'s desire but inability to forget their troubles through the dialogue . at the beginning of the play the audience is presented with a normal , loving family . the audience soon however , gets the suspicion that something is n\\'t quite right , and that the family is tense . slowly the family \\'s skeletons are exposed through arguments between the family members , but the characters always feel regretful for bringing the subject up . thus showing that no matter how hard the tyrone family tries to pretend that all is well , their skeletons are always with them and resurface to continually remind them of the truth . although i still believe \" long day \\'s journey into night \" to be thoroughly disheartening to read , the reader \\'s emotional response to this play leaves no doubt to o\\'neill \\'s exceptional writing . \\r\\n', \" this album bores me out of my mind . only two decent tracks : bad boys and bonnie and clyde . and i 'm no avid radio listener . bet and mtv actually hit the nail on the head with these tracks . so i guess they good for somethin \\r\\n\", \" i ordered this cd based on the reviews . first , i have to say that i am not sure why it is called ' paris under a groove' . i was thinking that it would be in french , at least . the beats are nice , i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar. . i just was n't as thrilled as i thought that i would be . it sounded very cheap . no originality . my fiancee is from paris , and this was very disappointing - not only to him - but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present....so far , it sits on the shelf. . \\r\\n\", \" i owned the vhs version of ' 'the wild , wild world' ' but decided to get the dvd this winter . well..that was a great purchase ! i understand people that could see the documentary of jayne in europe , as pretty cheaply made , but it is still jayne , and if you love her ( as i do ) , any film she was in ( except the girl ca n't help it , and will success spoil rock hunter ) was done on the cheap , with ridiculously small budgets . ' the wild , wild world ' gives you the chance to see a candid jayne in all kinds of very campy situations , and the best scenes are when jayne pretends to be offended by the goings-on.. . it shows a jayne mansfield who was indeed a true-original , rather eccentric person in the anal-retentive american fifties.i ca n't help comparing her to what anna nicole smith has done with her ' career ' as a media sensation , but jayne was doing basically the same fifty years ago , which was understandbly much more shocking for the common-folks . when jayne talks about her film roles , you wonder if she is laughing with you or at herself . i do n't understand how she can be compared to marilyn monroe.mm was looking for privacy , more serious roles , spoke to journalists only if she absolutely had to , when jayne was waking up her daughter in the middle of the night to prepare drinks for journalists who needed something to write about.jayne was not too picky about her roles , and the kind of attention she was getting , and it was her undoing.sad , but she needed the money to keep up that image , all those children , dogs , and...husbands . now , about ' 'the labyrinth of sex'' : it is hysterical ! ! and a great choice to make the dvd a double-feature , just like the good-old days of the drive-ins ! when you get over the awful dubbing , the documentary is rather well made , naive to today 's standards of course , but well-intentionned.some viewers will just see crass-exploitation , but if you are into campy , kitsch movies , and you see ed wood jr. as a genius...well you will love it ! .the movie trailers are very funny as well , and make you wish you could find them . so my conclusion is that dvd is an excellent purchase , a must-have for any serious jayne mansfield fan ! ! \\r\\n\", ' dragons are certainly among the most quintessential elements of the fantasy genre and their likenesses comprise one of the cornerstones of the art associated with it . dragonart : how to draw fantastic dragons and fantasy creatures is both an enjoyable browse and a useful guide for anyone interested in creating their own dragons or other fantastic creatures with pencil and paper . dragonart is divided into three major parts , fantastic dragons , unique details , and other fantasy creatures , along with an introduction , a section on how to use the book , and a brief guide to fantastic creatures . lessons in this book are progressive in nature , beginning with fundamentals and moving into increasingly advanced aspects of dragon design , all illustrated with step-by-step illustrations that are punctuated by helpful tips and tricks throughout . and author / artist jessica \" neondragon \" peffer has a clear , easy writing style that can be easily comprehended , absorbed , and acted upon , an example of which follows below . \" okay , so we \\'re going to discuss the anatomy of a creature that exists nowhere but in our minds . sounds kind of silly to say that something made from pure imagination does not look correct , but that will happen if your creature does n\\'t look believable . to help make your dragon as real as possible , base its structure on real creatures , \" she writes at one point ( page 44 ) . \" the ideal dragon is likely a mix of cat , bird , and reptile body types . the trick is choosing which parts to keep and which ones to throw out . you want it to feel like a single creature . \" this advice , incidentally , is very reminiscent of that given by leonardo da vinci in his notebooks for drawing creatures of this ilk , making peffer well read or naturally very insightful , either of which speaks well for her . under \" how you should make an imaginary animal look natural , \" the increasingly famous renaissance man writes , \" you know that you cannot invent animals without limbs , each of which , in itself , must resemble those of some other animal . hence if you wish to make an animal , imagined by you , appear natural - - let us say a dragon , take for its head that of a mastiff or hound , with the eyes of a cat , the ears of a porcupine , the nose of a greyhound , the brow of a lion , the temples of an old cock , the neck of a water tortoise . \" dragonart also includes guidelines on drawing a number of other sorts of fantastic creatures , including basilisks , chimeras , gargoyles , and griffins . for those interested in applying the guidelines presented in this book , a companion dragonart kit : how to draw & paint fantastic creatures that includes a compressed version of the book and some art supplies will also be available soon . author peffer is also the creator of the popular fantasy art website neondragonart.com , which can give anyone potentially interested in this book the opportunity to get a sense of the kinds of creatures they can learn to create themselves . \\r\\n', \" best hair dryer ever . i have long , thick , curly , frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then 10 minutes with the conair 213x , my hair is shiny and soft . the diffuser is also amazing ; i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz . by far the best dryer out there in this price range . granted , it 's heavy , but it cuts my drying time in half and i do n't have to style after drying which is another plus !

it 's a bit puzzling . although it is tame it is still darker and harder than the original . but the duff biochemical warfare plot is pure video game crap . i ca n't believe robert towne had a hand in writing this . it 's like a rejected plot to a solid snake ps1 game . there 's seems to be some focus on making it a james bond / die hard wannabe instead of respecting the source material and offering us any iconic or memorable set-pieces . another major thing that is wrong with this movie however is zimmer 's score . for a movie that is 124 minutes long we get about 30 minutes of music . zimmer is known for his talent of creating ambient and versatile music . but none of that is present in mi-2. this was movie was made around the time of his decline into mass-produced soulless stuff . which is also a shame . it 's the wrong plot , the wrong director and the wrong approach that turns this into a movie for idiots . they really under-estimated the audience and fumbled the ball with this one . john woo 's original cut was 3.5 hours long . none of that footage is on this new ' special edition ' dvd . what a waste \\r\\n\", \" i thought that i could never learn piano on my own . all the material that i ever looked into either did n't have enough information in it or was too complicated for its own good . because of this software , i am constantly learning new things , and slowly improving my skills as a future pianist . if you are a beginner , you want to buy this software . it 's done wonders for me \\r\\n\", ' in this sixth ( but not final ) installment of the movie series , what we get is little story and too much senseless action ( with a sprinkling of hot tub sex ) . this is a very disappointing film . although it is the last such lwnc movie from this creative team , it does not end the storyline ( with 28 volumes in the manga series , we probably would have needed another 3-7 films ) . so the patient , constant viewer gets instead a hack-and-slash film of mid-caliber . the ending - - an over-extending action sequence set on a snowy slope - - is very unsatisfying ; so are the characters : unlike other lwnc films , we do not get to meet any new incidental characters . as a result , the film is less about \" edo \" soceity ( which one cannot argue is the secondary if not primary goal of the manga team ) and instead just a big showdown waiting to happen...waiting , waiting to happen . the film is way too long and its pacing is horrible . i think the fault with the film lies in these two things : 1 ) the writers / filmmakers chose poor source material . the \" five wheel \" assassin team denies itto and son the chance to mingle with regular edo joes . as a result , you do not get as i argued the best part of the series : the rich detail of edo life . 2 ) the filmmakers must have been overwhelmed with james bond films like \" on her majesty \\'s secret service \" and whatnot with their decision to make this movie \" samurai on skis \" . after the first few minutes of fighting on the snow , i was thinking \" enough already , i get it : samurai can be badass even on slippery surfaces ! \" watch the first five and forever skip this sixth installment \\r\\n', \" this dictionary is not for the person who english is his second language . it does not have enough sentence examples to let you know how to use each entry word . in addtion , the micro does n't work well with ms word . \\r\\n\", ' i read bill bryson \\'s \" a walk in the woods \" and laughed hysterically at many parts of the book , and through the rest was either duly entertained or pleasantly educated ( for the \" educated \" aspect , bill interlaces the book with fascinating factual tangents ) . i started into \" in a sunburned country \" with similar expectations , and especially since i have always longed and planned to visit australia . to state that i was disappointed is a severe understatement . after reading this book i now have little to no desire to visit the \" land down under ; \" my only hope is that i will completely forget what i read in bryson \\'s book so that i may one day look forward to and enjoy visiting australia . ( senility be merciful and consume me hastily ! ) my best estimate is that bryson was commissioned to write a ~350 page book about australia . during and / or after his trip , his creative sense must have taken a vacation of its own . i have rarely struggled so much to get through a book as i did with this one . bryson even stooped so low as to use an urban legend as a \" story \" relayed second-hand from one of the australians he \" met . \" such a stunt makes me question if any of his accounts are real in any of his books . the only saving grace to this book was the educational tangents . these , at least , provided for some interesting reading . after comparing notes with another person who ventured to read another of bryson \\'s books ( \" i \\'m a stranger here myself \" ) after she read \" a walk in the woods , \" it would appear that \" in a sunburned country \" is not the only snore-fest that bryson has churned out . perhaps he is n\\'t a \" one hit wonder , \" but i for one am not going to waste my time or money finding out . so , if you are looking for the same caliber of writing that bryson provided in \" a walk in the woods , \" look to another author or prepare to be greatly disappointed . \\r\\n', ' i grew up watching sesame street and truly love the muppets . however , i have to say this video was not what i expected . there were some great vintage clips , but not enough muppets / monsters for me . this video seemed hastily thrown together with bad editing . i would recommend you pass on this one and get \" 123 count with me \" instead . \\r\\n', \" i 'm a spanish fan of soul music of the 90's . these days is almost impossible to find a good soul / r&b cd to purchase . in the 90 's i had to buy about 2 or 3 cds per week . now , with all the rap & hip hop topping the charts , what kind of music could i purchase ? luther , anita , lalah , smooth jazz & maybe , some joe 's cd . and of course , this terrific cd by mr.benson . if you 're a fan of good r&b music and you hate the hip hop music , buy this cd now ! ! ! ! you wo n't regret ! \\r\\n\", \" i like this movie . a meeting happened in our life is very special and nearly miracle , but we do n't think so almost always . the story except political things in this movie is thinkable around here . screenplay and performance of both bill nighy and kelly mcdonald have led this movie to the excellent one . ps : i do n't understand why this movie is not released in japan \\r\\n\", \" it 's not great music to dance to \\r\\n\", ' feeling more than a bit fleeced by mcafee \\'s overpriced \" subscription \" renewal every year , i decided to give kaspersky a try . installation went smoothly and everything seemed fine for 2 or 3 weeks . then one day my computer would not boot- --just stalled on a blank screen right after the windows xp splash screen . when trying to boot up in safe mode , a list of the drivers currently loading scrolled down the screen . it stopped at a file called kl1.sys and hung there forever . a little research at work showed that this was a kaspersky file . it may be just a coincidence that my system suddenly went kaput shortly after installing the new antivirus program , but i doubt it . attempts to use a recovery disk failed . a trip to the local computer shop revealed that the data on my hard drives ( which were in the inscrutable raid 0 format ) could not be recovered ( unless i wanted to ship them to a recovery shop , and nothing on them was worth that much ) . so they \\'re going to reinstall windows , i \\'ll have to do reinstall a shipload of software when i finally get my computer back , and , yes , i \\'ll lose all the data that was on there . ( gee , good thing i backed up all the kids \\' photos- --well , most of them . thanks , kaspersky ! ) anyway , perhaps my attempts at recovering the os caused the worst of this . whatever the case , i believe the boot failure was caused by either the kaspersky file being corrupted or a virus . who knows . kaspersky is to blame in both scenarios . i do know one thing : i am not going to tempt fate by loading this program on my computer again . and kaspersky has yet to respond to my e-mail . i got an automated \" we received your e-mail \" response , but nothing more , even though they state that they usually respond within a day or two . that was over a week ago . if in fact their software is in no way responsible for my computer flaking out on me , then i still do not apologize for the one-star rating , given their horrible customer service . if you decide i \\'m insane or that this was just a fluke , at least do yourself a favor and make a decent boot disk for yourself before installing this product . that might mean the difference between losing data / spending $$$ and just being inconvenienced . and do n\\'t expect much assistance from kaspersky should things go wrong . \\r\\n', \" my boy ejd is back , and so am i ! keeping it real , i took an eric jerome dickey hiatus . for years he held a special spot on my shelf as my favorite author , hands down . then it happened...his books just were n't doing it for me anymore . call in change , call it growth , falling off , call it whatever , but i was n't feeling it . drive me crazy drove me crazy and i could n't finish it . unheard of for me . chasing destiny came , but i let her run right past me . however , the title of his new release piqued my interest , so i decided to give it a shot and i am glad i did . death is life . gideon is a freelance hit man . in the seedy underbelly of death for hire , gideon is know as a man of talent and business ; a profitable business . he has a goal that he is trying to reach and with this acceptance of his most recent job , he just may obtain it . this job could put him over the edge financially and literally . has the hunter become the hunted ? sleeping with strangers is a smartly written , great reading drama / thriller that showcases dickey 's talent . he blended success , style and heartlessness . then he added some ruthlessness , deceit and trickery . let 's not forget murder , mayhem and steamy sex scenes . my hiatus is officially over . i enjoyed sws . now i ` m at the door , looking out the peephole waiting on the sequel to arrive \\r\\n\", ' ca n\\'t really add much to the reviews . this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older . i \\'ll admit that when this came out in \\' 94 , i only bumped the singles . it did n\\'t grab me at the time . sometime around \\' 97 i gave it a spin and i \\'ve been loving it ever since . there are plenty of bangers on the album , but classics like \" pour out a little liquor \" , \" str8 ballin \\' \" , \" how long will they mourn me \" , cradle to the grave \" , and \" under pressure \" make this album worth owning all by themselves . the rest of the songs are on point too - - there is n\\'t much filler on this album . the production is handled by warren g . & nate dogg ( 1 ) , the awesone yet underrated easy mo b ( 1 ) , johnny j ( 1 ) , jay & mopreme ( 1 ) , jay & syke ( 1 ) , stretch ( 1 ) , and thug music ( 4 ) . i \\'d say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks . the only tracks that i would call skip material are \" sh** do n\\'t stop \" and \" do n\\'t get it twisted \" . \" sh** do n\\'t stop \" is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive . the production is on \" do n\\'t get it twisted \" cool , but it \\'s one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it ( in my opinion ) . volume 1 is a passionate , if at times misdirected , release from the thug life camp . the production is nothing short of vintage mid 90 \\'s cali vibes . it holds up very well 13 years after its release . of course , if you \\'re a tupac completist , you probably have this album already . but even if you \\'re not a pac fan , this should be a part of your collection . r.i.p. tupac standout tracks : how long will they mourn me feat . nate dogg , pour out a little liquor , str8 ballin \\' ( my favorite ) , cradle to the grave , under pressure , bury me a g feat . natasha walker ( of y.n.v. ) \\r\\n', ' the easy language 16 is only useful if you \\'re already familiar with the language you wish to learn . i \\'ve been studying french for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when i \\'m getting rusty . the only problem is that it \\'s hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear . the recorded speakers also do n\\'t bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said . this is good cause it \\'s like listening to an actual french speaker and not a robot , bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said . it will also go over basic french grammar but is totally useless if you do n\\'t already know basic french grammar . i also tried to use this to learn japanese . unlike french , i \\'m not familiar with the japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare . if all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out . unfortunately the basic japanese grammar and japanese alphabet are all written in japanese . for instance , in the grammar section it has the past , present and future \" i am \" it \\'s written in english then beside it it \\'s written in japanese . you ca n\\'t click them to have it sound out for you . in the japanese alphabet section all it has is the japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out . so it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in japanese . i do want to learn how to read , write and speak japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read , write , and speak japanese ! so my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with japanese ( not the romanized ( romanjj ) version ) already in order to use this product . because of my experiences with this product i would say get it only if you know the languages you \\'re interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more . since i am familiar with french this product was pretty helpful but if i used this as a starter for the language i probably would have quit . i \\'m searching amazon for better japanese books . so if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and cd \\'s \\r\\n', ' this is a great show and very entertaining . the story is n\\'t the greek classic , but it \\'s a fine riff on it . the songs are good , and they grow on you as you watch . i take issue with the reviewer who thought there was gratuitous sexuality in the meg character -

i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches . you can also remove backgrounds from photos - it takes a bit of time to do , but the area around the image will be transparent - this functionality has many uses . you can also save your files in many different formats including .jpg for file sharing , etc. there are so many more features i could n\\'t possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates and do n\\'t feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software . you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program . you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities . the great thing about this program is that it is n\\'t just for scrapbooking . you can do all your photo manipulation in it . i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i have n\\'t been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using that version . i \\'m so glad i got version 10 as it is very user friendly too . but please know that version 10 ( which comes with this package ) is not the most recent version . version 11 is out now . if you do n\\'t want / need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes .png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having . i highly recommend the training videos on the cd - they really help \\r\\n', ' warning !

just in case you missed them ! ) , but all-in-all , this was a quite readable account of what \\'s presently known about cosmology . i use the term \" presently \" guardedly , as just recently there was some big finding about dark matter ( it exists ! ) , but from now on , when there are new findings in physics , i want hawking to explain them to me , because i feel like then i might understand them . that \\'s why you should read this book . the reason you should not read this book is because you have no interest in wrestling with abstractions with which you will never interact in daily life , and would rather read about global warming or darfur or something a bit more topical and practical . this was still a hard read , and i feel like i grasped maybe 80% of it . for you to decide , but for a former engineering student , this was something i wish i had read when i was taking physics \\r\\n', \" i have a question about this . i 'm wondering if i can hook my guitar into my computer and record it and then like add drums and loops an stuff onto it . is that possible on this program ? cause my friend has acid pro 4.0 and that is really awesome but it 's like $400 and i dont have that kinda money . wut i liked about acid pro 4.0 is that you could hook up ur guitar to the computer and stuff like that , so im wondering if you can do that on this program . if u have an answer for me , e-mail me at peepilott@aol.com . \\r\\n\", \" originally published in the early 1900 's , this book is an excellent resource for teaching young men about being their own self in a society that is trying to mold them into another copy . high adventure on the high seas . this book is impossible to put down . 75 years ago this was my grandmother 's favorite book . now it is mine \\r\\n\", \" if you want a nice camera that works well for 15 months , then look no further . but mine died completely and is headed for the electronic recycling bin . i did n't realize i was getting a disposable when i bought it \\r\\n\", ' i will not lash out against anyone , and i will not use specific names of individuals or organizations that replace the search for truth with a situationist relativism based on vainglorious , ostentatious egotism . that said , let me merely point out that the absence of necessary historiographical context makes jesus of nathareth \\'s solutions extremely difficult to accept . first off , it does n\\'t do us much good to become angry and wave our arms and shout about the evils of jesus \\'s morals in general terms . if we want other people to agree with us and join forces with us , then we must provide a trenchant analysis of jesus \\'s codices . the key point here is that jesus \\'s older analects were deluded enough . his latest ones are undoubtedly beyond the pale . jesus \\'s peuplade appears to be growing in number . i indisputably pray that this is analogous to the flare-up of a candle just before extinction yet i keep reminding myself that jesus has found a way to avoid compliance with government regulations , circumvent any further litigation , and violate his pledge not to condemn innocent people to death - - all by trumping up a phony emergency . his desire to control your bank account , your employment , your personal safety , and your mind is the chief sign that he \\'s a slaphappy caitiff . ( the second sign is that jesus feels obliged to force me to undergo \" treatment \" to cure my \" problem \" . ) perhaps i \\'m reading too much into jesus \\'s ravings , but they do n\\'t seem to serve any purpose other than to destroy the natural beauty of our parks and forests . jesus \\'s précis are pyrrhonism cloaked in the rhetoric of truculent , noxious feudalism . that \\'s pretty transparent . what \\'s not so transparent is the answer to the following question : does jesus \\'s oversized ego demand that he condone illegal activities ? a clue might be that every time he tries , jesus gets increasingly successful in his attempts to have a serious destabilizing effect on our institutions . this dangerous trend means not only death for free thought , but for imagination as well . jesus \\'s eccentricity is surpassed only by his vanity . and his vanity is surpassed only by his empty theorizing . ( remember his theory that the cure for evil is more evil ? ) jesus of nathareth has an agenda - - a political , social , and cultural agenda . and that \\'s all i have to say . \\r\\n', ' probably

software guru . i have also used other top level design tools and can tell you the fact is the corel draw suite x3 is a robust design suite that has a very palatable learning curve . the scope of what you can do with the software is amazing so certainly there is a new set of words to add to one 's vocabulary however with terms like pick tool , rectangle tool , ellipse tool , and the like , i believe that it is pretty logical to get an idea of what the tools do just by allowing the mouse pointer to rest over the tool for about three seconds so the application can display the tool name and even the shortcut key to select the tool . the icons also give a pretty clear visual representation of what the tool will do e.g. a capital a is the text tool and guess what you do with it ... it allows you to add paragraph text , and artistic text . after you learn a bit about the text tool you also see that it allows you to place text in your document on a path . the text on a path is just that.. . text on any path in your document . this can be a freehand line , an ellipse , a circle , or any other shape you care to make . how many of you have ever wanted to put your text in an arch ? in corel draw you simply make an ellipse with the ellipse tool , choose the text tool from the tool box , move the mouse pointer over to the ellipse and the mouse cursor changes to the text on a path icon and you click the left mouse button . now you type whatever you want around the shape that you have created . if the text is not the size , color , font , or position you want you can change it , color it , or move it simply by selecting the pick tool . i have developed a program to teach technology skills to middle & high school students with various disabilities in 46 sites throughout oklahoma and the corel draw suite is the first software application the students use . do the students know how to do everything with the software after the first week , or fourth , or tenth ? no , but if it took a week to learn it would not be a design tool in would be something like print shop pro where almost everything is done for you and you just type in the text . there is nothing wrong with psp but if you want to truly be creative , if you want to have the ability to design anything that you can see in your minds eye , then the corel draw suite is the tool you want . my program has a website that shows some of the work the students in the program have created . just do a search for tech-now oklahoma high school high tech and you should be able to find the site . the section on weekly curriculum is a pretty good place to start but i encourage you to look around . almost everything you will see on the site was created by the students using the corel draw suite . corel draw is

this razor for a few months and was happy with everything except the price of the blades . i have always cut myself occasionally , but when i cut myself with the fusion power , i got this huge cut

blood on the point of my chin . i tossed the fusion in the garbage , went back to the 3-blade , and wrote gillette an e-mail to complain , to which they did not respond . i 've read all 60 reviews

studio series has a history of being buggy . you also hear a lot of people saying \" this package is so much more intuitive and easy to use than the other \\' powerful enough to be worth owning \\' packages - - if only it were more stable ! \" i am one of those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back to version 9 ) , and finally with version 10.6 i have stopped complaining - - it now works as i \\'d hoped when i bought it . the $300 i spent on other packages trying to do better was wasted - - i kept getting frustrated with interfaces that a 500-page manual could n\\'t clarify . and i \\'m a very sophisticated computer user by most measures . i am turning all of our old family video tapes and cd \\'s into dvd\\'s . i use studio for all the editing ( have not tried the dvd recording - - just use roxio for that ) and am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 is a free download . one important piece of advice that would have saved me lots of problems : put every \" project \" you work on in a separate subdirectory . if you have 5 soccer game videos make a / game1 , / game2 etc. series of subfolders . if you edit those to a \" jimmy \\'s great plays \" proect , put it in a separate / jimmyplays folder . when projects are in the same folder and you edit them a few times weird overwrite problems can happen in 10.5. i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , and i do n\\'t know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why did i stick with something where i admit that version 9.0 was \" powerful but unstable \" and 10.0 was \" more powerful and more unstable \" ? because i can actually use studio with minimal reference to instructions , and when i use it things turn out as i expect . now that it has become stable and reliable i am a very satisfied customer . so that \\'s how i got from being a frustrated studio customer to giving it 4 stars on this review . i tell the whole story so you understand that the other reviews from frustrated people are relevant for the older versions , but that \" 10.5 updated for free to 10.6 \" really is the best choice out there now.. . as my unused expensive rivals to studio on my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder ! \\r\\n', \" as a lover of gospel bluegrass i anticipated an enjoyable listening session with blue highway 's latest offering . let me first say that i am a fan of this group , which i consider to be one of the premier groups in bluegrassdom , but what i heard was bluegrass muzak . yes , the group 's tight harmonies and excellent musicianship were in evidence , and that is what saved this disc from being sold to the local reseller , but the lack of inspiration and excitement was disappointing . gospel music , even bluegrass gospel , has a tendency to preachiness and taking itself too seriously as this disc proves . a good gospel recording must have some cuts which are humorous , some serious and contemplative , some that push the envelope of orthodoxy , and most importantly it must have an element of fun in order to keep the attention of the listeners . this disc fails in that regard containing standard old gospel chestnuts along with some original songs that ape the oldtime standards . my advice is to either borrow it from a friend before buying new , or buy used . want mine \\r\\n\", ' i have had this heating

level for a family of four in the united states was $19 , 806. 37 million people in the us live at or below this level . ron sider correctly asserts that it is morally unacceptable for 37 million people to live in poverty in this country while the wealthiest people are gaining a larger percentage of all wealth . in just generosity , sider presents his vision for overcoming poverty in america . and it is a compelling vision . sider \\'s vision is distinctive because he acknowledges that poverty is caused by both systemic injustice in society \\'s structures and by poor moral decisions by impoverished individuals . both must be addressed in order to stop cycles of poverty . drawing upon biblical study , sider presents the goal of an economy of justice : \" every person or family has access to productive resources ( land , money , knowledge ) so they have the opportunity to earn a generous sufficiency of material necessities and be dignified participating members of their community \" ( 81 ) . sider deals with a vast array of programs and issues like welfare , minimum wage , tax credits , health care , and education reform , showing how each could be employed in ways that encourage work , empower the poor , and strengthen families . sider ends with this troubling question : do enough christians really care ? this book should be required reading for any that do .

features all on one disc . the office 98 release for mac was pretty much the same thing . the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant ( paperclip ) but it is easy enough to turn off . office 2000 was a bit of a disappointment for me . i felt that the improvements were minimal ( aside from a bit more stability in word- -anyone who has ever used word 97 on a regular basis knows it 's prone to crashing ) and in fact detracted from the ease of use . one example is the clip gallery , which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that would n't have received decent reviews in 1988. another is powerpoint 's outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem . the menus , which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them , were also an annoyance . the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size . office 2003 continues making the program uglier . now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen . again , this eats into the workspace . the clip art system is even more cumbersome , and many of the clips are online only now . the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well . now some people may not complain , but what if you 're using a laptop in the middle of the country ? i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in 1997. in fact , the 1997 version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful . on my macs , i 've switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar . some of the templates also look very 1997. apple 's programs are updated on a regular basis , and their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then , but they should consider redesigning many of them- -such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy . the program is bloated way too heavily . i can run office 2000 comfortably on a 486 with sub-1gb hard drive , but ca n't even get 2003 on it . a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all . file maker is a better alternative , as it is easier to use and friendlier \\r\\n\", ' alfred hitchcock \\'s second film after being brought to america by david o . selznick was suspicion , which he made while on loan to rko pictures . as in his first hollywood flick , rebecca , he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star . fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw , a bookish and innocent ( but wealthy ) young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth ( cary grant ) . after their quick courtship and marriage against her father \\'s wishes , lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is- -a penniless leech- -but she naively continues to love him nonetheless . johnnie \\'s charm is ostensible , yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable . lina \\'s trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts . hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture . the movie \\'s only flaw is its tacked-on and seemingly contrived final scene which , we are told , was due either to mr. grant \\'s popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time . hitchcock wanted a darker ending but , as we see here , he lost that battle . however , he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe . the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities . suspicion is classic hitchcock . grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable \" beaky , \" johnnie \\'s old chum . the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock \\'s achievements , but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation . jeremy w . forstad \\r\\n', ' i have had several people take my pictures.at first , everything is fine.the pictures are ok.the next day , my face looks like a pile of baby vomit.it is

roll class at the university of cincinatti . i found the subject interesting , and the professor gave wonderful lectures . i had good expectations about this book going in , but those quickly soured as i read it . it seems correct , at least , about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock . not that such is a particularly daunting feet . however , it is rife with laughable fallacies . for instance , it calls david bowie , amongst other glam rock bands of the era , metal . it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the 60s and 70s rock , when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all , such as the carpenters . i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore . bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap . further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book . i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs . for instance , it claims ' thunder rolls ' by garth brooks is about domestic violence . its about infedility , not focusing on violence at all , but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on . the writing is also rather dry . many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence . it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band 's successes or failures . after reading the book in completetion , i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues ( 50s to 60s ) that i had thought were true . in the end , i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything \\r\\n\", ' i really wanted to like this book and the beginning started out great . a shocking murder is committed in the town of newpointe , then another . meanwhile , fireman mark branning has moved out and is separated from his wife allie . there is a serial killer targeting the wives of firemen and allie and mark must fight through their struggles for the sake of their marriage . i wanted to like this book because it is a christian novel with a good purpose . ninety percent of the books i \\'ve read have been secular but i \\'m starting to read more christian novels . but to me , this book fails for three reasons : the marriage conflict between mark and allie is n\\'t believable , the serial killer plot collapses under its own weight , and the spiritual message is confusing and disappointing . mark and allie \\'s marriage is suffering because she thinks he had an affair and he has n\\'t convinced her otherwise . seeing your husband hugging another woman is not proof of adultery , but it is grounds for suspicion . yet , allie assumes mark is cheating on her because she witnessed him hugging another woman . it seems to me the truth would be discovered in the resulting fight . instead , mark and allie separate and allie sees no hope for her marriage because of that hug and what she assumes was an affair . blackstock does a poor job of framing the conflict between mark and allie . throughout the book , references are made to allie believing mark had an affair with issie . allie refers to mark \\'s act as \" adultery \" and recalls him \" lying \" his way out of it after allie caught him hugging issie . their marriage is struggling , but blackstock should have given more reasons why allie assumed adultery other than a hug because throughout the book , mark says he did n\\'t have an affair and allie chalks it up to one of his lies . later in the novel , blackstock gives more reason for their conflict but by then its too late . the serial killer story is poorly done , and it also seems everybody knows everybody in this book . when they book a suspect at the end , it seems ridiculous . the police work feels like it was written by an amateur . one line in the novel , \" as much as the evidence pointed to xxx , stan did n\\'t want to believe it . \" in my opinion , the evidence did n\\'t point to that person and stan , the detective , seems foolish for believing it . there is n\\'t any rhythm or flow to the police work or the serial killer in the story . there is no sense of setting in the book . there are too many characters that no each other yet little context in how they know each other . finally , this book talks about god and prayer and being \" saved \" throughout the book , and that \\'s great . with a serial killer on the loose , a lot of bad things are happening and the characters react to this in a bad way . at one point , a conversation goes like this : \" how can the murder be part of god \\'s plan ? \" \" maybe it is n\\'t \" \" that would mean god is n\\'t in control . \" \" he is in control , but he allows some things to happen . \" then at another point , mark says to allie , \" i \\'m going to be fine , it \\'s time to trust the lord . he \\'s taken care of us so far . \" then allie says : \" but i do n\\'t know what his plan is . i do n\\'t know how he wants this to end . i do n\\'t know what he wants to teach us . \" at other points in the book , characters say that god has a plan and maybe the serial killer is part of god \\'s plan and that through god \\'s plan , all things can be used for good . this line of logic is infuriating . bad things happen to everyone , including god \\'s people . god does n\\'t \" allow \" a serial killer to shoot and burn your wife . that \\'s a horrible message to send to a non-christian who may have lost someone in a car wreck . telling them it was part of god \\'s plan is the quickest way to turn someone from god . god is obviously there for people when something bad happens to help them through it and to find the good in it and god can even keep bad things from happening to christians . but like above , where allie was afraid because she thought god might have chosen to have her killed to teach a lesson , god does n\\'t willfully kill people . it comes down to the simple fact that all people , including serial killers and christians , have choices to make and have free will . i \\'m surprised i wrote so much on an 8 year old book but i wanted it to be a good book . \\r\\n', \"

movie is very different than other holocaust movies , in that it explores the issue of what happened to jewish spouses of aryan women...the story itself is based on a true occurrence , and the movie

her mother 's past than she was ever told , and travels to germany to discover her mother 's past...the story is told in flashbacks through reminiscences , and basically focusses on the plight of aryan women in berlin whose jewish husbands have been confined in a place called rosenstrasse...i wo n't give too much away , but i must say that for a slow-paced movie , it is quite gripping as we are kept guessing as to the final fate of the jewish spouses...as for the acting , the characters from the past did an excellent job , their performances were very realistic , and heart-wrenching , especially the actress who plays the main role of mrs fabian fischer , the aryan wife . in the present day , the actress who plays the daughter who seeks to unearth her mother 's past was n't very

maximum i \\'m coherent enough to get up . if the light does n\\'t do it , you can add sounds ranging from a buzzer to screeching sea gulls- -ocean , wind , and ringing bells falling somewhere in

the lamp . secondly , you do n\\'t set the alarm for when you want to get up . you have to go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want to wake up and how long it will take you to get to that point . then you set the alarm for that earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use the sound in addition to the light , it does increase in volume as the light increases in intensity , but the sound starts out so loud to begin with that the light is really pointless . a workaround we \\'ve found for this is to use the external speaker provided . plug it into the back of the light , run it across the room , and bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick a sound like \" birds \" instead of the lip-curling \" harbor \" or \" town \" . from it

works . and it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but the design is just plain stupid . if the manufacturer would wander by here , read this and make a few design changes , they could make

. has three fan settings : med , high and quiet . \" quiet \" really is quiet , and could probably work just fine in a bedroom . though , it does warm the room it \\'s in . how much it warms it depends on the humidity setting . four settings : the humidty level ( humidstat ) can be set to \" continuous dehumidification \" ( which is the default setting ) , 50% , 60% and 70%. the fan will continue to run but the dehumidification processor will turn off when it reaches the selected humidity level . cool . i mean , that \\'s when the fan will just blow room-temp air . a full drainage tank will stop the unit and illuminate a \" tank full \" indicator light . the unit is not that heavy - - maybe for some , but not nearly as heavy as some people make it sound . it \\'s 30.8 pounds . according to the instructions : you will need at least 21 cm ( about 8 inches ) of clearance in front , behind and side to side . air blows out of the top of the unit , so you \\'ll need to make sure it \\'s clear as well . there are movable louvers on the top to direct the air straight up , 45-degrees or almost straight ahead . power consumption : cfm-25e is 220w / / cfm-40e is 330w i highly recommend this model dehumidifier \\r\\n', \" it 's easy to realize once again what makes garth ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one . throughout the story i was unable to

antonia fraser for many years , i highly anticipated her biography of queen marie-antoinette , but have been very disappointed in that she often chooses the sensational over the factual . she depicts marie-antoinette 's mother empress maria theresa as heartless and calculating for sending her daughter to france at age 14 to get married , but arranged marriages were the norm ; the empress was not doing anything out of the ordinary . what startled me most is that fraser not only insists on antoinette having an affair with count axel von fersen , of which there is little concrete evidence , but goes onto maintain that axel used condoms to keep the queen from getting pregnant . it seems to me that marie-antoinette loved children so much ; she came from a family of sixteen where children were valued and her more liberal sister caroline went on to have eleven children or more . she was also a devout catholic and using such devices were unthinkable , unless one was a prostitute or dealing with prostitutes . in this case fraser is applying the morals of some british aristocratic ladies to a queen of france . if marie-antoinette had been caught in adultery , it would have been considered treason ; she would have been sent to a convent and had her children taken away from her . with all of her enemies at court , that was not a risk she would have taken , if she had been so inclined . on a smaller scale , fraser makes ridiculous assertions about marie-antoinette dyeing her hair - in all the pictures that i have seen of her , her hair looks grey from either powder or premature age ; i have never read any first hand accounts of her dyeing it . not that that is a big deal ; but it makes me wonder where lady fraser 's life ends and where marie-antoinette 's life begins . i found it offensive that at the end fraser interprets marie-antoinette 's death as some kind of sacrifice for the cause of democracy , when she believed in monarchy and wanted her little son to be king . especially , since marie-antoinette 's murder was followed not by democracy but by dictatorships and napoleon crowning himslf emperor . sadly , there is a lacuna of decent biographies of the queen in the english language . one can only hope that the works of bertieres , chalon , and delorme will soon be translated and published in english . fraser 's book does have some interesting details ( aside from those which flow from her imagination ) and it is much more sympathetic to the queen than lever 's travesty \\r\\n\", ' what is the song that is being played when they are handoing out the dance

enjoyment with their abilities . however , if there is one quality i 've always admired in metallica , it is their lyrics . they 've always had excellent lyrics in their songs , and that was what got me to keep buying albums . however , i ca n't credit them for any lyrics on this one . unfortunately , we 're dealing with a bunch of covers . some of the songs are pretty good . the only one i can say i really like is turn the page , though seger 's original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it . it 's got decent music , and the vocals are n't bad . metallica just could n't figure out how to honor a classic , and they occasionally sounded like james was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang , leading his voice to sound overly forced . other songs , like killing time , were not spared on this album . unlike with turn the page , metallica did n't even do a halfway decent job covering this . they destroyed a pretty good song . and to be honest , metallica 's guitarist just ca n't compete with sweet savage 's ( vivian campbell ? ? ) . tuesday 's gone was also destroyed . it was too slow and acoustic , but not in the good way it was in the skynyrd original . in this case , james ' voice was terrible . it sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it . that is , at least , the effect i get from it . overall , if you 're a die hard fan , you wo n't like this . it just does n't have what metallica did have for songs back with ride the lightening and master of puppets . if you 're just looking for some metallica , you might as well get this . as

for this album , i am getting labeled as an emo kid who wears his sweater too tight , cuts himself and cries over his girlfriend all day long , well too bad that \\'s not me , i am just a normal person who can tell the diference between bad and good music . hawthorne heights is an emo band who are criticised by lots and loved by lots of others , i have to agree that their lyrics are quite simplistic and are used over and over , they might even sound gay at some points , although , \" we are so last year \" made me laugh \" i should have known you better , i should blame it on the weather \" wtf is that ? ? ? anywyas so the lyrics are probably the reason why i \\'m giving this 4 and not 5. but here we \\'re talking music not lyrics . the music has nothing very special to it and i can play every song on guitar , they often use the same chords except for a few songs \" this is who we are \" , but they have a lot of interesting melodies and do n\\'t just rely on power chords to make their music interesting . even though these chord sequences are often re-used , hawthorne heights always manage to make their sound diverse and interesting and they are slowly imposing themsleves as the kings of knock-out choruses . the other thing i have noticed in this album is that there are much less screaming parts which is an improvement and the guitarist has finally learnt where his place is in the band ( behind his guitar ) but also when is a good time to scream and when it isn\\'t . this makes them quite different from most other emo bands who literaly destroy their sound with high shrieks . hawthorne have become a little darker and even tune down their guitars in some of their songs now adding a bit more heavyness . also check out \" where can i stab myslef in the ears \" to see how hawthorne have improved . overall this is a step forward from their last album , it wo n\\'t change the emo scene forever , but it will leave its mark in your memories and will give you a good moment when listening to it \\r\\n', \" this is the one i buy for friends and the one they use at my pediatricians office . it is like the one i bought 5 years ago with my first baby , the one

story with a social background so great , it is almost more important than the plot . \" mystic river \" differs from lehane \\'s other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer . \" mystic river \" is set in the fictional boston suburb , called east buckingham ( the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester , charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester ) , home mostly to white working class , with plenty of crime . i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it , knowing the area.. . the first part , which is the base and explanation for later events , takes place in 1975 , when one of the three eleven-year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple-smelling car , and although he comes back after four days , his life as well as his friends \\' is changed forever . the ways of the boys soon part , dave ( the boy taken by the men ) lives a quiet life , has a wife and a son , and likes his memories of being a football player in high school . jimmy , the \" bad boy \" , after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen-year old daughter from his first marriage , second wife and their two daughters . the third boy , college-educated sean , becomes a policeman . when jimmy \\'s beautiful daughter , katie , is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood , sean gets assigned to the case . there are many leads to different people.. . but the case is difficult . meanwhile , jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own . the plot is very good until the end , and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate . the characters are very real , especially jimmy and sean , who are central to the plot . their trauma after dave \\'s abduction made a lasting effect on their lives - in very different ways . they are complicated , multifaceted people , very well developed as literary characters . some side protagonists , depicting perhaps types rather than individuals ( bobby , roman , the savage brothers , sergeant whitey ) , are very good . i was in the grasp of this book until the end - it is not only great entertainment , but also food for thought . the movie based on \" mystic river \" with sean penn is equally moving - recommended for those with little time.. . \\r\\n', \" this was my very first book for nora roberts , and so far it 's the best book ever . it is the perfect book . brianna is a wonderful , smart inn keeper with many talents

ordinary romance . i love that it goes deep , not only into the main characters ' personalities , but there is also brianna 's sister and brother-in-law , her mother , her friend , and gray 's agent . not to mention the wonderful scenary of ireland described throughout the book . the conlcusion of the book is wonderful and utterly satisfying , leaving you with a happy glow that lasts a long time !

1999 for my business . this version is one of the best advances i have seen . the new home page shows the various work-flows in an easy to understand format , making it easy to get to the form i need with one click . i really like the new \" centers \" for customers , vendors and employees . most of the information i need when looking for history with a customer or vendor is available when i click on the customer or vendor name . with one more click i can easily see the original transaction . i used to have to go through several screens to get to the information i needed . the industry customization in the premier edition is a great addition and well worth the additional investment . i have a client using the contractor edition . the contractor center provides a quick glance at how the business is doing . the job cost reporting is an excellent tool to help better manage the business by comparing actual to estimated costs . they have been able to improve their estimates based on the information quickbooks makes available to them . the key to having the information you need is to make sure you get it setup properly in the beginning . spend some time reviewing the excellent on-line training and help before you setup your company files . if you do n\\'t like reading the instructions , another option would be to get the help of a local quickbooks proadvisor for assistance

of her characters . sugarpuss o\\'shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive , good-looking gentleman . but she also shows her love to the other professors . 1941 was stanwyck \\'s greatest movie year.....she made \" meet john doe \" and \" the lady eve \" in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them . stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything ! ! from drama to comedy , to musicals and of course westerns ! ! while stanwyck \\'s singing is not on a par with her other talents ( her singing was dubbed in ball of fire ) she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her 1937 film ( this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer ) . bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting . she could n\\'t sing or dance ( as barbara did in ball of fire , lady of burlesque , this is my affair and banjo on my knee ) . katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms , high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical . she could n\\'t sing ) . joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she could n\\'t sing . doris day was brilliant in comedy , musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy . the same with judy garland . rare is the talent who could do it all . i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all....drama , comedy , westerns , musicals ! ! heroine or villainess ! stanwyck \\'s work is always first class even when applied to material that is not . she was simply the greatest and i \\'m sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in 1941 for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses ! ! the movie , ball of fire is great fun ! !

tweak audio and video input on the fly is incredible . now that i am creating a multimedia team for our church , i 've convinced the church to buy one for themselves \\r\\n\", ' i should have left this review a long time ago . i could kick myself for buying it , thinking it was a film , not a religous object . if you critisize this film amongst religious radicals , you risk being burned at the stake , an act of love to purify your soul . this film , as a film , disregarding the topic , is a dog . a cheap \" b \" grade , blood spurting , flesh flying horror flick in aramaic with sub-titles . i could go on for an hour , but wo n\\'t bother \\r\\n', ' what i like best is that it is non addictive . it puts you right to sleep within 20-30 minutes . it really helped me and my boyfriend

incident is in jeopardy from union thugs and has initially has guards . but as the jeopardy increases , the guards are n't there . no followup mention . what happened to them ? some vulgarity in language . but all in all , a great fun read . \\r\\n\", \" you know , i actually enjoyed the first mummy . it was funny , the idea , not often seen in modern films , was good , and the characters were each , in their own way , entertaining to watch . why , god , why did they have to go and make a sequel ? i do n't understand . was it for the money ? ? ? i 'm not sure when exactly i began to hate this ; maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake again . really , you 'd think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it 's thousand-year rest they 'd learn their lesson . but oh , no ; the first time was n't enough . and , also , the whole having a kid thing , did n't seem to work . the relationship between the characters was n't the same anymore . i hate it when they do that in movies : make sequels and give the once-cool , main characters children . nothing against it , just felt wrong for this movie . throughout most of this movie , i felt stupid , and i do n't like for things to make me feel that way . i also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater . maybe it 's just me ; i just did n't like it . question of the day for american cinema : what 's the deal with being obsessed with sequels ? ? ? ? ? come on , the first was good enough . you know what the worst thing is ? -i was actually looking forward to seeing this \\r\\n\", ' i got this device to help me clean around my place . i thought it would be easy to use , and

because that is what this piece of junk is worth . \\r\\n', \" my ownership of this camera was brief . first , you must know i love nikon . i have 2 other nikons- -an old cooplix 2200 and a coolpix 5700. they have wonderful lenses and give great pix . i thought my experience with this model would be similar . not ! ~ from picture numero uno , the lens cover refused to completely open and cooperate . i got pictures , yes , but they had lazy black eyelids on each corner where the lens cover had not opened up to clear the lens . what a dissappointment ! i traded it in for a canon a520 and am happy with that camera . i suppose it is just what it is . if i 'd saved and spent a lot more money on a d50 or rebel , who knows ? anyway , that is my sad tale with the nikon 4800 \\r\\n\", ' i bought one of these items in december \\' 04 from adorama . it had directions written in raised letters on the canister itself . i just ordered here and received a second one in march \\' 07 and the

gram silica gel \" \" when pink , reactivate 3 hours at 300f \" the pink referred to is the little circle in the center of the canister . i keep this product with my camera ( in closed stuff sack )

walmart , which rarely carries books regarding shambala or any other eastern ideology . it was cheap and on the clearance rack . i should have know better . when i realized this was part three in a series i decided to read the first two books , the celestine prophecy and the tenth insight in order to be able to better appreciate the third one . after borrowing and reading the first two , i realized what a sham this series truly is . first , i realize they are supposed to be fictional . however , when a work of fiction attempts to use historical background for its premise , the author should first do his homework and make sure the historical facts are completely accurate . additionally , when usurping a mythical name such as shambala , one should know what the actual mythology entails , instead of making up one 's own notion of what is involed . shambala is not the same as shangri-la . shangri-la was a fictional community in a book written in early 20th century western culture . shambala is an ancient eastern mythical kingdom that is in no way similar to the fictional place in redfield 's imagination . also , beware of writers who combine religions and mythologies . as joseph campbell said many times in his lectures and books , they all contain the truth as seen by different cultures , but they must never be mixed together . it just does n't work \\r\\n\", '

am looking at new software because the service that this company provides and their complete lack of a proactive nature with regard to its useability have rankled me one too many times . to wit : 1. i am running a dual core 3.0 with 1 gb of memory and the 3d draw is slower that previous versions . 2. tech support had the audacity to tell me that going to a drop down menu to rotate an item selected is faster than a right click of the mouse and a context menu that would allow me to do the same from that menu . this is a step backward of at least 10 years . previous versions had the right click menu which also had delete and other frequently used commands available . really piss poor on their part to eliminate this feature alone . 3. despite a fast newer machine , once you select an item you have to wait before you can move it by selecting it a second time . pitiful . 4. wo n't import standard dxf files without saving them as one layer . making a product that wo n't play nice with others

and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds . the one i purchased was flawed , and would take 5 or 6 tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up . when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures . what the description of this product does not tell you is - the frame does not come with a usb cable - so it does not hook up to a computer . this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera , or that you must have / purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card . ( a side note - if you have a sony digital camera , memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format - so forget about using pics someone else sent , you took with another camera , or you reformatted with a photo program ) . i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead -

\\r\\n', ' tihs dvd truly has incredible camerawork , and fully illustrates the intelligence and beauty of dolphins , but some things people do n\\'t realize about dolphins kept in captivity need to be told . please take the time to read this . many dolphins you see in aquariums and swim-with programs and circuses around the world often come from brutal drive hunts , during which dolphins are rounded up into very tight nets concealing them , and are dragged ashore making it easier to violently wrestle them into slings . these dolphins captured , while they may be smiling in appearance ( which is the way their faces were genetically designed ) , are ripped away from their beloved podmates and torn from their environment . how would you like to be a dolphin who once lived in a vast sea of blue and then suddenly be taken into a shallow pool of water , forced to live with the loud sounds of people screaming , the filtration system running , and very little space to swim ? in the process of capturing dolphins for human entertainment , many die in the process . stress severely affects a dolphin \\'s body , and many suffer irreperable damage to their hearts in the execution . on top of that , dependent calves ( baby dolphins ) who have spent the entirety of their lives with their mothers , often get torn from them , leaving them helpless , even if they are released . while you can clearly see in the film that many of the dolphins appear to be having fun , would it not be too much to consider the fact that they might miss their former companions ? are they really happier stuck in a cement tank forced to perform tricks in order to be fed ? keep this in mind the next time you visit an aquarium or swim-with program . for dolphins captured in japan , the industry has been given permits to slaughter a number of them needlessly in the process by the government . i believe this film spends too little time in the beginning addressing the human threat to dolphins . over 7 , 000 , 000 dolphins have died at the hands of humans since the late 1950s . i think a few minutes at the beginning of the film does n\\'t nearly suit the need to inform the audience of the issue . tuna fisheries , whose products are falsely labeled as \" dolphin-safe \" ( there are established \\' kill minimums \\' now for tuna companies ) need to be exposed . intentional killings in japan ( especially ) , south america , and all over the world need to be publicized . but i also understand that this is a family film , mainly , but i think it is also important to inform young viewers of the problems dolphins face with humans . they are the ones who will need to make the difference in the future . please just remember this next time you watch this film . while dolphins are valued by many , they are targeted by many as well as a way of easy money-making . this film is more of a sugar-coated production , although it certainly is beautiful , as are the dolphins seen in the flim . i would recommend a film entitled \" dolphin defender \" for those who seek some informative footage behind the scenes to what really happens to dolphins in drive hunts . \\r\\n', ' i use pdfs a lot and

main cause of this book . this is not a book about cosmology ( as people would expect from roger penrose ) . in this tiny book , penrose summarizes his idea that the mind cannot be understood by

easy to understand and the ideas are very concise and its recommended for the ones that are interested in intelligence theories ( thus , the author assumes that the reader know what a neuron is and how it works ! ) . some may think this is a difficult to understand book because they did n't had in mind that this book is about penrose 's point of view on intelligence . in fact , i 'm not a physicist , nor a biologist , simply a high school student and i found the book very easy to understand , although i do not agree with penrose 's point of view . i think he forgot something very

he makes nicholas to be . yet there are photos extant of nicholas smiling as he played with his children . nicholas was also portrayed as obsessed with holding on to his power as tsar . but in the robert massie book after which the movie was purportedly modeled , it was very clear that nicholas was acutely aware of his responsibilities to the russian people , as well as to his family , and above all his son , the future tsar . there was nothing exceptional about his behavior ; most of europe at the time was ruled by kings and queens , and to all of them , the thought of losing their thrones was simply unthinkable . yet this film falls into the trap most of us do , of judging history not on the basis of its own terms , but with our usual spectacularly accurate 20 / 20 hindsight . having been fed soviet propaganda for 75 years , we have it entrenched in our minds that nicholas was an extremely poor ruler . that \\'s the stunning success of the massie book , that someone who had absolutely no connection to russians , and no connection to royalty save for the one coincidence of both their sons having hemophilia , was able to overcome the general ( and erroneous ) \" knowledge \" of his time and write the kind of sympathetic biography of this family that was long lacking . the movie , on the other hand , makes nicholas look petty , and alexandra slightly over the edge . one petty anachronism was the scene that showed the royal family praying just prior to nicholas \\'s sending off his troops into world war i . it was badly researched , to the point of ludicrousness . the tsars of russia were all orthodox christians . orthodox christianity has its own very distinctive music ; in fact , russian orthodox chant is very different from greek orthodox chant . so what kind of background music did the director choose ? gregorian , of course ! can we at least *strive* for a little authenticity ? ! apparently not . massie wrote in considerable detail about the attitude of the romanovs towards their captors , how their guards had to be changed every three or so months because they kept winning over the bolsheviks : \" you are n\\'t anything like what we thought , \" was the most frequently quoted comment on the subject . the movie showed nothing of that . well - - in the end , it was this exact trait of graciousness and consideration towards their captors that ended up getting the romanov family canonized in the russian orthodox church . that movement was well underway by 1971 ; i wonder , if the directors and producers had done a little more thorough research , if the film would have been a tad more sympathetic to these five people caught between two worlds and two cultures . all in all , purchasing the movie was a waste of money . maybe the bolsheviks over at the university \\'s russian department will appreciate my donating it - - that way , others can get to see it without wasting their money \\r\\n', ' by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in 86 years . it \\'s true , the patriots somehow pieced together a team that , despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a 17-2 record ( which just as easily could have / should have been 18-1 ) ...but the 2004 boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the 2004 patriots season just does n\\'t seem to measure up to the previous title years of 2001 and 2003. part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities ( 2001 having 9 / 11 , the coming-of-age of tom brady , the snow bowl , and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever . 2003 had the release of lawyer milloy , the early stumbles to buffalo and washington , the birth of the winning streak , winter weather in foxboro , and yet another thrilling super bowl finish ) ; 2004 just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison , like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the \" w \" on the patriots \\' side of the field . this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling...the injuries ( leading to the incredible \" throwback \" two-way play of veteran wide receiver / rookie cornerback troy brown ) , the continued winning streak , the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon , the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts , and the return to pittsburgh ( where the record 21-game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween ( just days after the red sox won the world series , karmically enough ) , where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple-digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl , this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville , fl . no nail-biting endings this time , though...despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else ( with the possible exception of curt schilling , of course ) , the eagles all-pro was clearly the second-best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day ( safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick , actually ) and the patriots , though trailing early , never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by 10 points late before prevailing by the final score of 24-21 which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved . far be it that a season ending with a record of 17-2 and another super bowl ring should be considered hum-drum , but there was something missing from the 2004 campaign that , impressive as it was , just does n\\'t translate to the memorable re-telling that the pats \\' previous title years do . this is a great dvd for pats fans , indispensible even , but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring , i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd \\'s over this one \\r\\n', ' if you take lots of photos , rechargeable batteries are the way to go . carry the

it looks in the stock photo . 5. fast . switches on and is ready for the first shot within about 1.5 seconds . other things i liked about the camera : - good ergonomics . fits nicely in my hand , all the buttons are well placed and easy to access . i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand . - powerful flash . enough to fill up a moderate size room . - great video mode with sound . it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv . - lcd is decent size and is fairly bright , which means it 's even visible outdoors in the daytime . things i did n't like about the camera : - manual could be more detailed . there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide . but there was no 40 page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail . - the auto focus illuminator ( for help in focussing in low light ) is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes . but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions . - does not come with a battery charger . i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately . i have owned the olympus c720 uz and the newer sony dsc s600 , but i think this camera is better than both of them . \\r\\n\", \" this is a great cd ! each track fades up to full volume at the start and fades down to silence at the end .

this just arrived thursday so these comments come with minimal time on camera so far . i am also absolutely an amateur user of camcorders so i wo n\\'t be able to comment on the quality of the manual controls , etc. i agree closely with the other two reviews so i wo n\\'t repeat their details . i \\'ll try to hit a few other topics and also compare the hc7 to the sony hc90 , an earlier model that took 16:9 standard definition video with 3 mp stills . i have taken about one hour of hd video so far , and have viewed it through an hdmi cable on a sony 46 \" xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured a few indoor scenes , a few neighborhood outdoor scenes , and some footage at harper \\'s ferry in west virginia - river , mountain , and two trains passing by at close range while i was at the railroad station there . i can say comfortably that you wo n\\'t confuse the video from this camcorder with standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they are n\\'t kidding . if your tv can show the video off to advantage and you \\'ve grown fond of hd , i think you \\'d be pleased with this camcorder . in my case , the overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders was to get the hd video , so this has made it worth the steep expense . my second requirement is to have a camcorder that took decent stills so i only have to carry one piece of equipment around . i already had this in the sony hc90 at 3mp , so going up to 6mp was desirable but not enough to make me buy something this expensive in itself . my only output criticisms so far are that the west virginia footage looks a little brighter and the water a little greener than i remember . i did n\\'t play with any settings so take that with a grain of salt . these camcorders have a lot of manual adjustments you can make which i have not explored . one or more of them undoubtedly would have given me improved footage , and i \\'m not unhappy with what i think i noticed in the slightest . the stills look very good to me so far , but i \\'ve only taken about 20 and viewed them on the tv . i normally view stills on a pc . i do n\\'t have a telephoto lens yet so i ca n\\'t report on the quality of the stabilization . i used a tripod today and that was readily apparent in the stability of the video . i was very pleased , by the way , with how well the camera did with the moving trains . very crisp where i expected a fair bit of motion blur . lcd size and controls have been mentioned in first looks . i \\'m perfectly happy with a 2.7 \" lcd instead of the larger one in the ux7. so this was n\\'t a negative for me personally . the controls ( menus ) are highly similar to those of the sony hc90 i already have . if you have n\\'t seen them before , there \\'s a learning curve . if you have the hc90 or another camcorder with those menus , you \\'ll be right at home with the hc7. one note : you can configure p[ersonal]-menus to include the things you use the most in your own order , in addition to the camcorder \\'s menus . one thing i forgot is that each mode ( video , camera , play / edit ) has its own configurable personal menu . so i was looking for things to add to the play / edit personal menu that i was sure should be configurable , but could n\\'t find them . that was because they belonged only to the filming side , not to the playback side . so you \\'ve got three personal menus you can create , not one . battery : check the sizes on the batteries . the hc90 batteries were very thin . i think three of the batteries for the hc7 fit entirely within its case . the fourth and largest battery looked to be much bigger in one dimension such that i thought it would extend past the end of the camera 1 / 2 \" or so . the other three will fit flush into the back of the camera , though they \\'re not behind a door or anything . battery life : my impression so far is that the battery life statements are accurate , but the batteries drain faster than that of the hc90. this is almost certainly a function of increased power load instead of the older batteries being better than the newer ones . the ccds and the stills and everything are all \" more \" than in the hc90. so i think i \\'m fine with the battery life , but you \\'ll need to watch it and definitely have more than one battery . size compared to the hc90 : this struck me as being about 10-15% bigger overall than the hc90. it \\'s maybe 1 / 2 \" longer front to back , and wider as well . i think the hc7 is one notch up in size from the average camcorder i see in best buy . but it \\'s noticeably smaller than last year \\'s sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i do n\\'t see dropping this one in a coat pocket like i did with the hc90 , but it \\'s pretty light and still fits in the case i used for the hc90 if i do n\\'t load other stuff in there . fit in the hand : i found a best buy with an hc5 and ux5 on hand and played with both at the same time . these have the same footprint as the hc7 and ux7 as far as i can tell . the hc5 \\'s tape case is maybe 3 / 8 \" wider than the ux5 \\'s dvd case . the ux5 \\'s dvd case is maybe 1 / 4 \" higher . so i found that my right-hand fingers curled nicely around the smaller but taller ux5 and it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found that the hc5 \\'s extra width made me curl my palm slightly such that the base of the camcorder fit solidly on top of the ball of my thumb . as i played with this in the store , i realized it seemed like the hc5 actually was easier to hold stable because of this . absolutely try these two out on your own instead of assuming this will be true for you . just wanted to say that the two cases do differ a bit and will probably feel different to you at some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ) : i spent a lot of time wondering if the noise reported in last year \\'s avchd ux camcorders would still be present , and if i would care in any case . the detailed reviews still are n\\'t out , so i do n\\'t know whether there will be a noise problem there . but i can say i noticed nothing in the footage so far that i \\'d call noise , so my decision to go with the tape and hdv format looks very good to me right now . i have never had the problems people report with mini-dv tapes , so that whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) did n\\'t weigh on me much . the noise discussion did have an effect on my decision , though . getting the video to your tv : \" how much money do we have ? \" , apparently . i played the tape back to the tv directly , but that \\'s not a long-term solution . i have heard that you can capture the hdv video and then will be able to transform it on a pc to formats suitable for blu-ray or hdv burners , if you have the money . then you need a blu-ray or hdv player attached to your tv . for now , it sounds like many people are archiving the hdv video to dvds as data files . then they burn playable dvds where the hd is down-converted to standard definition video . so they get to see decent versions of the video now and can produce hd versions for playback in the future as technology changes and prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied that hd files captured by ulead software could be moved to a ps3 hard drive and played back to an hd tv from there . so far , the easy and cheap path we have for sd video to dvds to tvs is not quite there for hd based on what i \\'ve read . the one extra feature i wish the camcorder had was a built-in 20x optical zoom . i \\'m sure this would affect both the cost and the size of the barrel negatively , so i \" understand \" . but that would be #1 on my wish list . overall , i am amazed at what camcorder manufacturers can pack into these shells now . i know we \\'re talking computers that are way more powerful at image processing than anything that existed ten years ago . but it is still almost like magic to drag a camcorder of this size around , take some video , and then have play it back on a high-quality hd tv looking to me like it was taken with broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it \\'s really great to have a camcorder like this that marries up with the new tvs so beautifully . \\r\\n', \" i 've owned this camera a little over a year . it was my 2nd digital camera . it always had focus issues in low-light . i thought it was me , but after working extensively with the manual

showcase for star natasha richardson . unfortunately , the film poorly tries to condense too much plot and things happen so fast that the film fails to fully explore the psychology of its characters in cinematic terms.. . a pretty major flaw for a movie that is supposed to be an exploration of the psychological effects of sexual obsession . the basic plot concerns the affair between the bored psychiatrist 's wife ( an excellent natasha richardson ) and one of the asylum 's patients ( an equally good marton csokas ) , under the watchful eye of the patient 's doctor ( ian mckellen ) . there are several plot twists in the last part of the movie , some of which seem quite preposterous , at least in the way the movie was shot . the only reason to watch this movie is to see natasha richardson . she does her best in spite of the choppy script , and she even won a best actress award in london for this film . however , as a psychological thriller or an exploration of sexual

[people] who claim that it \\'s a story about racism either do n\\'t understand the film or do n\\'t understand racism . basically , here \\'s the plot : the character played by mekhi pfeiffer is an unwitting accomplice in a botched armed robbery that leaves three people dying on the floor of a grocery store . rather than summon help for the others , all pfeiffer can think to do is help himself to the money in the cash register . he is caught , and in the ensuing trial the prosecutor calls him an animal because of his depraved indifference to human life . that is supposed to be the psychological turning point in the film , because pfeiffer \\'s family insists on proving that he \\'s no animal and can take his punishment - - in this case , death - - with his head held high . yeah , right . guess what ? he is an animal , and if the story had involved all-black or all-white characters , racism would n\\'t be an issue . a more compelling question : if pfeiffer \\'s family was so concerned with his \" dignity , \" why did n\\'t they teach him moral values in the first place \\r\\n', ' the product is so so , there are others that do the same thing for a bit less . but

of users opinions and found it has lived up to their high opinions . i have boxes of family photos as well as numerous camcorder tapes of family events . i wanted an easy comprehensive program that would let me arrange photos and video clips , add music and burn on a dvd . this program does it all and more . it may not do everything extremely well , but for the price , well enough to put out an impressive dvd . after about two hours of getting familiar with the program , i was able to create a dvd that had 35 pictures and a video clip with background music - stunning results . i played the dvd on several different brands of dvd players and had no problems . looks great on tv . i 've had no problems running the program on my computer - i 'm running this on a pentium iv 2.9 ghz , 1 gig ram and 200 gb ram hd . since i am a beginner / weekend hobbyist , this suites my purpose of sharing pictures with family - i 'm finding much better to share on dvd than paper photos . for an

\\r\\n', \" the main reason for negative reviews in the past was the extra charge for the mp3 encoder . with this version , the mp3 encoder is included . magix has been pretty clever in designing an interface that can used quickly yet has several more advanced features you can use as you become more proficient . these include a full featured waveform editor and a very powerful sonagram ( spectral ) editor . also , somewhat hidden is the ability to record 78rpm records on a 33 1 / 3 turntable . if you use the full set of features almost any record can be made totally free of pops and clicks . i have two very minor negatives ; the amplitude scale on the track display is somewhat truncated , the declicker has so few artifacts that i recommend always using it at the maximum setting ( as opposed to the wizard and manual recommendations . ) as far as pc requirements , i believe any program that does a lot of number crunching needs a fairly up-to-date processor . this one particularly so because it leaves the original audio files intact . i do n't believe this is a negative as in some prior reviews . in short , i have been totally satisfied with this program 's ability to make clean transfers of both 78rpm and 33 1 / 3 rpm records . \\r\\n\", \" i guess it 's cheap , but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight , so it 's pretty hard to get anything

husband . her husband , it seems was a great admirer of the giant panda and in his journal he writes a beautiful story about his experiences with them..this leads ruth to seek these pandas out to see for herself..as the story unfolds we see the beauty and majesty of china..the cinematography is outstanding and the music fits the film quite well. . ruth is played by the lovely maria bello and there is an additional documentary about the making of this film is which she talks about her reasons for wanting to do this film and her fascination with the panda. . all in all..this film is a nice way to

he was not able to get the gigs he used to get , which is itself really sad . he developed what i think is the best comedy , which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as

explanations of the spring framework . writing a book is no small feat , and technical books are a special beast . with that last statement in mind , this is were the book sadly falls short . for one , the source code available online is a significant rewrite of the books \\' code . the authors explain ( on the publisher site ) that this is because they learned better ways and techniques to implement the samlpe application after the book went to print . while improvement is always good , this presents two problems . 1. the sample application is now out of sync with the material . not a good thing for those trying to learn , as you require more effort to study in tandem with the book . also , and this is not to disparage the authors skill , but i buy books because i am expecting experienced , if not expert advice . if a small , sample application needs rewriting , perhaps they should write about something else ? further down this road , the sample application has errors that prevent it from compiling . i suspect that the final build file was not tested , or it was a case of \" well , it compiles on my machine \" . there were several dependencies that required changes to the build file so it could be compiled . thankfully , i use eclipse and imported the project . eclipse immediately informed me of missing dependencies , which i resolved by getting those jars on the build path and in the build file so they would be deployed in the war archive . examples are : jakarta-commons / collections , and several core spring jars relating to dao and database access . for an experienced developer , familiar with ant and a good ide , it was not a lot of trouble to get it running , it just did not give me a good impression . bonus info for anyone switching the database out to postgresql : first , no matter what db you swap in , you \\'ll need to change a few hard coded references in the build file . i made property variables which i placed in build.properties . then you will need to change the class user to something else ( and of course anything in the app that references it . ) . another great reason to use eclipse . why you must change it , is user is a reserved

again . &quot ; yup , he shot himself in the foot again , just like he did on tristania 's & quot ; beyond the veil . &quot ; veland has an obvious talent in songwriting and building arrangements , and he definitely has a knack for surrounding himself with quality musicians . his problem is that rather than using his death metal growling for proper effect , where it 's appropriate , he just plasters it everywhere , and again lessens what would otherwise have been an incredible cd . with all of the talent that is present in this band , it would certainly have been better to let them come out of the background a little more . the songs where veland does that ( which are all too few ) , like & quot ; on the wane , & quot ; are easily the cd 's best moments . to the band 's credit , the songs are more varied than on botv , with some of the guitar parts sounding like more traditional heavy metal riffs ( especially at the beginning of the opening track ) . it 's definitely still melodic goth-metal , but shows some new directions for veland , which i find promising . now , if he would just cut back on the growling...say to 50% of the cd...sirenia 's next cd will be a sure

flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional - which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain ( to some ears , overpowering ) seriousness , cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous & quot ; o daddy be gay&quot ; , a cousin to her & quot ; grandfather&quot ; recorded years later.althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for days , these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks ( voice will soar much higher in the future , she slipped w.b.yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first-rate art-pop singer ) and as they were product of their greenwich village times , they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears.but they are still hauntingly beautiful to me , i waited their

worst , most pointless , and most inane garbage that i 've ever had the misfortune to view . contrary to popular belief the alien was not cute he was creepy ! the little boy was extremely annoying ,

spielberg 's classic masterpiece jaws did not have a stellar plot . it was a bubblegum storyline : a monstrous shark terrorizes a beach town on the east coast . in the hands of any other director , it would have been a terrible film , something to laugh at on lonely saturday nights while chowing down popcorn . in the hands of mr. spielberg , however , it became one of the very finest and most memorable films ever made . steven spielberg 's hands were nowhere near jaws : the revenge . okay , so here 's the plot . remember jaws 3-d ? well , that never happened . chief brody - from the first movie - is dead . his wife , ellen brody ( lorraine gary ) , is living a happy life in amity until her youngest son is killed - by a great white shark . ellen flies down to the bahamas with her other son , michael brody ( lance guest ) . though her family and friends assure her that she is crazy , ellen believes that the shark from the first movie - yes , the one that chief brody killed - is back for revenge , hunting down her family and killing them one-by-one . even though it died . in the first movie . confused ? any sensible moviegoer would be . it 's best to completely shut down your brain while watching the third jaws sequel . as you now know , the story is completely absurd . the script , by michael de guzman , is unintentionally hilarious , filled with outrageously funny dialogue . for example , in one scene , pilot hoagie ( played by michael caine ! ) is courting ellen brody . hoagie : i have an irresistible urge to kiss you , ellen brody . ellen : why ? hoagie : because ... it would not occur to you why . and if that 's not confusing enough for you , feast upon this nugget of dialogue , from a conversation between michael and ellen brody . ellen : why did you come out here ? why did you come out here ? michael : mom ! mom ! why did you take the boat ? ellen : it [the shark] kept coming ! michael : do n't you realize what you 're doing ? ellen : i 've tried to tell you , there was nothing else to do ! michael : mom , you should n't have done it . ellen : i 've tried to tell you , i 've tried ! joseph sargent 's directing is terrible ; it 's clear that the actors have no clue what they are doing . which may be why the acting is so horrible . the highlight of the cast is lance guest , whose straight-faced performance overshadows the very talented michael caine 's by a longshot . the horrid acting is forgivable , however ; after all , how could someone even attempt to keep a straight-face in a film so absurd ? a film in which sharks roar , swim from new england to the bahamas to kill family members , and leap thirty feet out of the water ? on the plus side , jaws : the revenge is enormously fun to watch , thanks to its ridiculousness and unpurposeful hilarity . it is very likely one of the worst films ever made - jaws 3-d looks like the original when compared to this film - but if there 's nothing else on tv some late night , grab some popcorn and a frosty beverage and enjoy the absurdity that is jaws : the revenge \\r\\n\", ' my girlfriend made me buy this video after a night of dancing at the local club . all i can say is

carson . the media killed this movie before anybody had the chance to judge it for itself . yet , in the mid 80 \\'s , it came out on both betamax and vhs , and naturally i bought me a beta copy to judge for myself what kind of a movie it was . first , it is not a drive in movie or one made for mass consumption . it is long and intraclly woven together . it is lavish and sometimes loud . it is a brutal slap in the face to \" manifest destiny \" and a cruel dig to the sickos that even today claim that this is \" god \\'s \" country . as if their \\' god \" gave them wealth and privilige and that this god justifies revolution , massacre and war . many comparisons can be mase with the america of the late 19th century and the america ruled presently by king george w . and his robber barons of capitalism . but it is now , as then , much more conveniant to steer the \" common man \" into their churches , into their army , into their lies . the enemy is those \" illegal aliens \" those in the \" gay agenda , \" those who dare to investigate or challenge the status quo . kris kristofferson plays a mayor / sherriff if wealth and means who ( shock-shock ) sides with the common man and the undertrodden . when another of his \" breeding and class \" challenges him on why he stands up for the underdogs and not his own class , he replies to the creep : \" you are not of my class , to be of my class you first have to die and be born again ! \" this is a revolutionary movie , meant to be savored , each and every minute of it . this movie dares you to look at things usually not into history books or shown on the history channel \\r\\n', \" this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices . he hit the time , the place and the kids perfectly . this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share , i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about 10 billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me.. . this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world . i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday . its a great movie and i 'd recommend it to anyone . you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about... . growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which is n't as bad as it sounds . plus great script / dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell . its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the 1950 's over this era . \\r\\n\", ' these are excellent performances for a very reasonable price . the look of some of the videos as well as some of the film stock is \"

on details but rest assured it \\'s all great stuff ! \\r\\n', ' few \" metal \" bands can successfully integrate melody into their music without falling back on the overused \" power ballad \" . tesla seems to be able to turn it on when needed , and shut it off when unnecessary . this debut from the sacramento quintet is full of enough speed to satisfy any metalhead , yet also contains enough substance to satisfy those who want more from their rock than double kicks and 140 on the metronome . the album starts off with a great rythym section groove , then growing and ripping into ez cum ez go , a song that takes the listener up and down more often than a valencia theme park ride . comin \\' atcha live seems destined to be the song that the band opens their live shows with , falling back into the rif-filled melodic offering of \" getting better \" . then the pace swells again into \" too late for love \" , and thunders into the anthemic fist-pumping \" rock me to the top \" . \" we \\'re no good together \" may start like the dreaded power ballad as jeff keith laments about the proverbial one that got away , but screams to a conclusion through a profusion of lightning fast ( pun intended ) guitar solos . \" modern day cowboy \" is the token political anti-war statement , slows down a bit for \" changes \" but up next is one of their fans \\' favorites . \" little suzi \" begins with a tasty acoustic piece , and progresses into the culmination of the bands \\' melodic songwriting talents as they chronical the ups and downs ( pun intended ) of a young starlet discovering the high costs of fame . i \\'m a little surprised at the way the album closes , though . after the huge highs through the middle of the album , the final three cuts are somewhat disappointing to me . do n\\'t get me wrong , they \\'re still decent , but i would have liked these three shifted to the middle of the album and slid the rest towards the end - \" little suzi \" would have been a great way to end the album . overall , even though the band did a lot of great stuff ( including their biggest commercial success ) in later albums , this remains their best body of work \\r\\n', \" while well produced , i was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings . frankie laine still sounds great - but it just was n't the same

's definitely not the album i 've loved for over 30 years ! high noon in particular is quite different , much slower , with vocal emphasis changed . i 'll probably listen to the cd from time to time , but not with the same relish that i enjoyed my old lp \\r\\n\", \" alright , for those of you who say rand is criticizing works for false ideals , or lacking in substance , i say this : who is rand to say what the absolute greatest ideals are ? who is rand to say what substance is ? you 've got to look at her bias , first . realize that rand never takes into account anything not related to personal freedom . as if outside factors never matter ; and maybe they do n't , for her . maybe her life in an oppressive russia did nothing to form who she is today . but i doubt it . though i believe personal choice plays a huge factor in determining who we are and how we live , outside influences do affect a person . but she doesn't . thus she condemns all works that are not driven solely by the individual as crap . all books that are not driven solely by the individual 's sense of reason : do n't read , cause it will lessen your iq . any work that portrays or is driven by an emotion she does n't find worthwhile or cannot understand , she condemns . rand , at least as portrayed in what i 've read of her work , is unfeeling toward anything but what she wants . and this is carried over into this book in what she criticizes . they cannot hold a little or a fairly large amount of quality , they are either good or worthless . the pieces of art she says are empty are empty , absolutely . they do n't fit into her paradigm thus have nothing to offer . nothing to offer her , that is . how is a completely selfish person supposed to write a critique of history 's best books , telling other people ( with different wants and ideas and all the other funtions of an individual ) what they should read ? truthfully any criticism in this form , like a list i saw detailing the 100 best literary works in the world , is elitist crap trying to close people 's minds toward books that a certain group deems lesser than others . they have their bias like anyone else . i say read in variety . observe art outside of rand 's choice of art . take in all you can , with an open mind , then start pondering whether you agree or not . if you then agree because you agree , then i say great . its the basic individualistic response that rand seems to forget to address . she says question society , but by my line of inquiry . she says be an individual , but only i know the basis of who you want to be \\r\\n\", \" they just do n't have movies like this anymore . this is not a movie that makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal to the young audiences who like flashy stars on sceen . this is

looking at him so weird when he was telling them this later in the movie . he finds out alright . keith david plays his friend who tries to keep his spirits up and this is definitely his best role . he cheers him up in a great scene where they get extremely baked . the supporting cast in this movie is unbelievable and no flat performances here . overall this is my favorite movie of all time . it has stood the test of time and never fails when i want to see a good movie . i just have the old special edition , not the 20th anniversary but the extras are very nice . it has a commentary from the

as it is , the always wily and oh so goofy character of kramer is playing a game of risk and exclaims that the \" ukraine is weeeeak \" . this causes him to get a thorough scolding and a little bit of trouble . i think the same basic sentiments work with this new order release . it probably was n\\'t worth the ungodly long eight year wait although it produced the excellent \" rock the shack \" and of course \" crystal \" , which i \\'ll get back to later . unlike kramer i feel i can make this statement safely as i \\'m not dealing with a burly , alcohol swigging ukranian , but new order fans , which are n\\'t the most intimidating bunch out there . keyboardist gillian gilbert is not here as she felt taking care of her kids is more important , which it is , maybe . this album features the guitar of billy corgan , the frontman of the seminal 90 \\'s group soundgarden . too bad they could n\\'t get billy to collaborate five years earlier because at this point he was already full blown crazy , and was n\\'t writing very good material or really using his guitar , at all . new order also made the mistake of having corgan to backing vocals . now a synth is high pitched and shrill enough , but to top that off with a billy corgan squealing like a pig cherry is probably not the best choice . so...someone like you is more or less unlistenable . it has some pretty terrible lyrics about how bernard does n\\'t want to wash his car . now i can relate , i would n\\'t want to wash my car in britain since it rains all the time and would probably be an altogether futile affair , but this topic does n\\'t result in the most captivating and well-written material . new order occasionnally want to rawk out with guitars on this album , something they do n\\'t do very often , just like van morrison . now i \\'m not sure if i \\'ve heard a van morrison song but i \\'ve always figured it was a give that they rawk out with guitars . case in point of this ` not so good of an idea rawking \\' is rock the shack . rock the shack kind of sounds like new order \\'s take on someone commissioned to write an epic gilligan \\'s island rock song , pretty amazing huh ? \\' 60 miles an hour \\' , ` primitive notion \\' , and ` close range \\' all suffer from being a little too vanilla and a little too bland . new order have patches here where they sound like they might be suffering from the same middle-aged blandness that has crippled other 80 \\'s artist like depeche mode , the cure , and tears for fears ( who \\'ve actually always blown ) . however , they do succeed fully well on two songs here . there is ` crystal \\' , which is truly an excellent rock song and show new order can succeed with a harder guitar edge and is probably one of the two or three best songs of new order \\'s career from the 90 \\'s and beyond . how this did n\\'t get more airplay than it did is a mystery to me , because it has the alternative rock of today written all over it . the other is run wild which is really a great little slow song , in the vein of ` as it is when it was . probably new order \\'s only full-fledged ballad it serves as a fitting acoustic , moving ending to an otherwise disappointing album . get ready is good beginning and end , just not end between . kind of like that movie twin peaks : fire walk with me \\r\\n', ' i think they should place a disclaimer at the top

( one suspects , in fact , that had fitzgerald abandoned his muddled third-person narrative altogether and rendered the work instead as amory \\'s diary the result would have been considerably more readable - - or the book \\'s structural and methodological flaws considerably more forgivable , at least . ) that the novel was a roaring success upon publication in 1920 - - it was to prove the most popular book , in terms of sales , ever produced by its author - - presumably speaks to the public \\'s recognition of something new and revealing in it . okay , amory blaine may well have been the original jazz age prototype ; and the drinking and shameless smooching ( etc. ) that he and his prep school and princeton friends indulge in at various points in the novel were probably , one can accept , a revelation to see in print ( and likely a titillating one ) for an american audience raised on mcguffy \\'s readers - - and ready for some sort of great departure after the great war . welp , here it comes : \" on the triangle trip amory had come into constant contact with that great current american phenomenon , the ` petting party . \\' none of the victorian mothers-and most of the mothers were victorian-had any idea how casually their daughters were accustomed to be kissed . \" to the reader at a remove of some 80-plus years this is , of course , very small beer . what was alarming frankness in 1920 tends to read now , in the best cases of the paradise narrative , as unalarming quaintness . while this is not exactly fitzgerald \\'s \" fault \" , so to speak , it is also true that the use of \" shocking revelations \" of this type - - scandals specific to a place and time - - represents a risk a writer takes : the march of history may or may not reveal something lasting and / or universal in such episodes . in any event , the price the reader pays here , in slogging through the meandering narrative which surrounds amory \\'s adventures in quaintness during the nascent roaring twenties , is very , very high for payoffs of such modest proportions . i mean , come on : \" for years afterward when amory thought of eleanor he seemed still to hear the wind sobbing around him and sending little chills into the places beside his heart . the night when they rode up the slope and watched the cold moon float through the clouds , he lost a further part of him that nothing could restore ; and when he lost it he also lost the power of regretting it . eleanor was , say , the last time evil crept close to amory under the mask of beauty , the last weird mystery that held him with wild fascination and pounded his soul to flakes . \" yikes . i do n\\'t care what new generation you \\'re talking about , can a flake-pounded soul really represent much of an innovation to anybody ? ( can it represent anything to anybody ? ) there are things to like , even admire , here and there in paradise . fitzgerald gets off a few of the wonderfully epigrammatic lines that were to become a trademark ( e.g. , \" they slipped briskly into an intimacy from which they never recovered . \" \" sometimes i wish i \\'d been an englishman ; american life is so damned dumb and stupid and healthy . \" \" it \\'s better to leave the blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes ; they do it so much better . \" ) and the political incorrectness of some of the narrator \\'s observations is , in its now-curious way , refreshingly , bracingly funny : \" slowly and inevitably , yet with a sudden surge at the last , while amory talked and dreamed [which is about all amory ever does-mht] , war rolled swiftly up the beach and washed the sands where princeton played . every night the gymnasium echoed as platoon after platoon swept over the floor and shuffled out the basketball markings . when amory went to washington the next weekend , he caught some of the spirit of crisis which changed to repulsion in the pullman car coming back , for the berths across from him were occupied by stinking aliens-greeks , he guessed , or russians . \" nothing like a little wretched refuse to remind you there \\'s a war on , i always say . anyway , most of the novel consists of young amory \\'s elaborate ponderings - - romantic , philosophical and egotistical - - which are as forgivable as they are forgettable . i \\'ve forgotten them already . at some level , in any case , fitzgerald himself had to recognize the ridiculousness of this pompous character - - who was , of course , a not-very-disguised version of himself . for how else , if not as commendably self-deprecating irony , are we to take this observation ? \" amory was in full stride , confident , nervous , and jubilant . scurrying back to minneapolis to see a girl he had known as a child seemed the interesting and romantic thing to do , so without compunction he wired his mother not to expect him , and sat in the train and thought about himself for thirty-six hours . \" in the end , in any event , one comes back to the initial fitzgerald vs. fitzgerald comparison with something like gaping wonder . in paradise almost nothing works : form , content , narrative stance , dialogue , character development , pacing - - you name it , it \\'s a problem . yet in gatsby , five years later , everything works - - everything . if there is to be a great american novel , it will have to supplant gatsby for the honor . while it is hard to see how fitzgerald got from point a to point b , the fact is that he did - - and without point a the journey could not have begun . so while \" this side of paradise \" hardly deserves a place in the national literary canon , it surely deserves our respect , and indeed our gratitude , for what it led to . \\r\\n', \" i have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly . there are a lot of good books out there , dan harrington 's the very best , but this isnt one of them . too much ego here and not enough helpful information \\r\\n\", \" the neutrogena norwegian formula foot creme was a dream for this mother . my 7-year-old was unfortunate enough to inherit a severe callous problem that affects his hands and feet . the problem is so severe in his father that his father 's hands and feet are literally split open and very painful . the 7-year-old has already started with very hard calluses and nothing seems to relieve them . nothing , that is , until now . just a small nightly dose seems to be helping immensely into giving my dear son back the soft feet i would expect a 7-year-old to have . i highly recommend this product to anyone who suffers from dry , cracked feet \\r\\n\", ' easy to use , including zoom and uploading to computer . nice clear photos when printed out \\r\\n', \" just bought a sony t9 in tokyo last april 10 , 2006 ( 7 months ago ) . and suddenly 2 weeks ago , the screen went dim practically can not see anything . the power on / off also not working . all happened at the same time . try to repair at sony service station in shanghai as i am residing there for the moment . very indifferent customer service staff refuse to repair , despite that i do have a world wide guarantee card and the receipt from the tokyo shop as well as the complete boxes . the sony people there are really not helpful at all . most probably we suspect , they do n't want to shoulder the cost for repairing under guarantee from sony worldwide . it is shameful for such a big name like sony . definitely , i will not buy again from sony . change to olympus for the replacement and also cancel my bravia lcd purchase . i do not recommend buying goods from sony as you might have the same experiences ( poor hardware quality and services ) \\r\\n\", \" this is a great bag . it fits the camera perfectly and has room for all of the accessories as well . i 'm very pleased and was happy that amazon carries the item as we could not locate it anywhere else \\r\\n\", \" undoubtedly the worst ' best of ' dvd ever made , even if someone gives this dvd as a gift you should punch that person in the face...after watching this dvd i felt like burning down the company that made this dvd . if you want to play a practical joke on someone then might as well give this dvd to him as a gift . there might be emotional reasons why there were some positive reviews of this horror , but it ca n't be for the actual dvd . there are n't words to describe how bad it looks and sounds . shame on the band for putting this out . obviously all them cares about is getting the money and run with a ' best of ' on dvd . this item should be removed from the shelves for poor quality in picture . my taped videos on vhs from mtv and vh1 sound and look better than these ones , really . this essay in amatuerism may have some interest . for worse , is unforgivable is not including the whole video stuff from 90 's to 2000.

. \" those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result . staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times . the author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit . i know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time . they fell apart due to abuse , infidelity , and just plain incompatibility . what i feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents . when you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids , most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house . when you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority , who constantly disappoints , hurts , and replaces the kids , there will be damage , no getting away from it . however , is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids , seemingly with the other parent \\'s approval ? i hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion . it is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married . this is a major flaw in the research . i did n\\'t see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference . i do n\\'t think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens , you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears . when you put your own personal interests

just all works , and is comparable in every way to the extraordinary \" nowhere \" by ride ( not quite as great as \" loveless \" by my bloody valentine ) . unfortunately , c.w. never quite matched the power of \" ferment \" with their subsequent releases . the best song on the album is \" black metallic \" ( \" it \\'s the color of her skin / her skin is black metallic \" ) which soars up to

tiny battery cover . it came loose and i lost it on the golf course . fortunately , i recovered it amongst the green grass . the cover is also green . i now put a tape over it to secure the cover .

fully fleshed out characters and a plot that kept me guessing . i got neither . the characters were neither likeable nor substantive . except for the cop next door , i have no idea what they even look like or what , if anything , they care about besides dogs . the plot was predictable and the action stuck in first gear . maybe the series inmproves after this book . i 'm not taking that chance

. \" this first dave was in the dumptruck , tractor and farm truck versions - maybe a few others - and is pretty unbearable for parents as far as how silly he is . the newer dave ( dave hood ) is in all the rest ( along with his sidekick , becky , in some ) and is much less goofy than the other dave . i do n\\'t think the kids really care though...the sillier the better and my son loves them both . anyway , i started with the dumptruck one when my son was almost 2 and he was immediately glued to the tv . i do n\\'t let him watch cartoons and try to limit overall tv to things that are at least somewhat informative / educational . as a result , he was never one to sit and watch much tv ( made it hard for me to get things done ! ) . but , with this series , he enjoyed watching the real live machines and vehicles ( and some of the more goofy moments ) so much . it really was a lifesaver at times . needless to say it did n\\'t take long for me to collect the entire series . i have watched them along with him and learned quite a bit about different occupations . my in-laws were farmers and really enjoyed watching the \" tractor \" and \" farm truck \" versions with him . his favorites include \" there goes a firetruck , \" \" there goes a monster truck \" and \" there goes a spaceship . \" but , he literally rotates through all of them and has over the past year plus ! i ca n\\'t say enough good things about the video series as far as my son \\'s enjoyment goes . just do n\\'t look for any oscars for the acting and editing . it \\'s pretty choppy , even for an amateur eye . i would highly recommend any in this series if your child likes any type of machine or vehicle . \\r\\n', ' this is the album that all kenny g fans have been waiting for ! ! ! it was well worth the wait

is best consumed in this form . yes there are too many pop culture references , yes the hulk is a little goofy and the ultimate nick fury has virtually nothing in common with his regular universe counterpart but i think once your done with this gigantic , thirteen issue epic powerhouse you wont have much left to complain about . this story arc takes the alternate universe avengers from their creation to their first major victory , ill let someone else spoil it for you but its good . the second volume is juuuust about complete as of november 2006 and is pretty amazing as well . this is the best that the ultimate universe has to offer , is one of the few titles exploring fairly original ideas and has not been reworked specifically to appeal to teenagers , no inline skates , teen angst , or first love in this one . millar and hitch are a great creative team but their ability to make deadlines is positively absurd . these thirteen issues took the better part of three years to be released and i read every one of those issues as it was released on the news stand . my wife got her msw in the time it took the skrull war to unfold , it sucked and the new series isnt much better . thankfully it has only one issue to go , hopefully well get it before theres a new president in the whitehouse . removed from the delays the series is a pretty impressive achievement , the art is top notch and the story is positively crackin ! yes it \\'s \" just \" a super hero comic but its one of the best , so if you like the medium and are lucky enough not to have read it yet do yourself a

simplistic \" it \\'s bad to hate \" message . what the creators of princess mononoke and others like them refuse to admit is that hate is a natural reaction and even healthy when directed towards the destructive , disgusting things of the world . yes , hate can become overly consuming , just as any other emotion can overcome us , or we an hate the good things of the world making us the bad one \\'s , ( just as loving that which is evil would n\\'t be a good thing ) but placed in its proper context at the proper time , at that which deserves hate helps us avoid dangers and deal with certain problems . and the people who claim that hate is all-evil themselves hate the \" haters \" , which i find comical . the movie also has strong pro feminist / anti man messages . i wanted to like this

be paperport . i had read somewhere that the software becomes incredibly slow with a large number of files . i guessed a large number meant 2500+ at least . this concerned me , so i called pre-sales at scansoft , and asked if it was slow with a large number of files . he was not sure ! so he told me to call technical . i called technical , and it his responses were very slow and sounded like he was reading them out to me . i asked if he was reading the scansoft website and he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site for an answer , and did not need to be paying international call charge for someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself to read it . i got the software . basically all the software consists of is windows explorer and scanning software . it worked well , and i thought ok , expensive for what it is , when windows explorer and scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly do most of it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it was my machine so installed it and the pdfs on a new vaio 1.7mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click to view the pdf then hit the return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view a document , it takes a good few seconds but then when you hit back to the paperport desktop to continue it takes 12 seconds ! ! ! completely unusuable ! if you have less than 500 files , it is maybe expensive software , but for more than 500 do not waste you money . it runs so slow you can not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away with it - surely they should have tested it internally with thousands of files \\r\\n', ' from a pure image quality standpoint , this lens will not please the pixel peepers . on the wide end of the zoom , which i personally use more often than the telephoto end , this lens is not very sharp , and it suffers from fairly bad distortion . worse than that , for me , are the chromatic abberations ; this lens is quite prone to significant ca when shot at the wide end , which can look a lot worse than a little bit of distortion or softness . given the price of this lens , one should expect a higher level of optical performance . the maximum aperture of this lens is not very large , being f / 4 on the wide end , and f / 5.6 on the telephoto end . the image stabilization makes up for this some , as you can comfortably shoot at much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let \\'s be honest here ; this lens is a poor performer if you want to shoot in low light with no tripod . the small aperture makes for a dark viewfinder , which can be a very big problem if you are trying to compose a picture in the dark ( using a tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , and this is not without reason . first of all , the focal length range is quite handy . it is n\\'t a mega-zoom that does everything , however , it covers the most often used focal length ranges , and is an appropriate lens to use for the vast majority of situations . the little bit of extra zoom on the telephoto end is handy on occasion , and it \\'s also worth noting that the lens sharpens up quite a bit when you zoom in some - it might be soft on the wide end , but zoomed in , it \\'s quite good . i have printed as large as 20x30 \" using this lens on a digital rebel , and have no qualms with the results . yes , there are sharper lenses out there , but you are a lot more likely to see the difference in sharpness on your computer monitor than in a print . this lens has ring usm , which enables it to focus very quietly , and very quickly , whereas the slightly cheaper ( and f2.8 ) options from the 3rd parties have normal focusing motors that are slow and noisy by comparison . if you want to use this lens indoors , you are best off getting a flash to go with it , such as a 430ex . the lens is usable in fantastic indoor lighting , or during the day , but wo n\\'t give you good results in low light with no flash . if you will be shooting in lower light situations ( people in particular ) , tamron and sigma have some good options in the 17-50mm range with f2.8 apertures , and i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you \\'d prefer the extra telephoto range , the image stabilization so you can shoot with smaller aperture in poorer lighting situations for greater depth of field ( instead of needing to shoot a landscape at f / 4 , for instance , without image stabilization , you could use f / 11 on this lens , and get a sharp picture with better depth of field . this is even more useful in the close focus range - while this is n\\'t a true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without a tripod , you will want to stop the lens down for greater depth of field , and the is helps with that quite a bit . overall , i \\'ve been fairly pleased with the performance of this lens . if you like to worry about splitting hairs , and zooming all the way in on pictures on your computer , this lens is likely to dissapoint you . if , however , you are willing to sacrifice optical perfection to get a very well rounded , useful lens , then i \\'d recommend it , however , would also recommend that you consider the 3rd party options , as they are also great lenses , and do offer a somewhat better value \\r\\n', \" i got this curler set , and i completely regret it ! i used it once , and i wont touch

first-timer , it has been great . the camera rates 4 stars . customer service , on the other hand , has been a disaster . an easy share software downloaded update did n\\'t load properly and led me on a trail of three customer service reps over the course of 4 1 / 2 hours with no resolution . after requesting to speak to a customer service manager , i was promised that a $7.95 cd of the software would be sent for free ( though it was clear he was doing me a favor because \" these cd \\'s cost money and do n\\'t grow on trees , \" he said . whether or not the cd solves the problem remains to be seen . but customer service is awful . to recap : nice camera , but unless you have endless customer service patience , search out other options \\r\\n', ' i purchased this camera in december 2005 to replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size is inferior in the panasonic compared to the \" ancient \" sony . the color is not nearly as sharp , the low light capabilities are laughable and the battery lasts half as long . the sound quality was adequate if not watching playback on the camera itself . the camera \\'s highest volume setting is too low to use if you want to listen while loading video into your computer \\'s editing program . the panasonic does have a relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting in auditoriums with spotlights . it uses a toggle to control the exposure and , while it is not as easy as the external thumb wheel on the sony , it is adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly in low light it would n\\'t provide adequate color in an auditorium . i thought the image stabilization would be a great feature but my video is much shakier with the panasonic than my old sony . maybe it \\'s because the camera is so small it \\'s hard to keep as stable as the larger sony . video editing on a pc is equally easy on the sony and panasonic but the panasonic \\'s poor user manual would make it very difficult for a novice to figure out and your picture quality will be much better with sony \\'s digital 8. if you do n\\'t have to record in minidv format or have a built in 3 megapixel still camera , i \\'d recommend buying an inexpensive sony digital8 for about a third of the price of the gs250. if you do have to have a minidv camera and you wo n\\'t be shooting in bright sunlight , try another brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder will now have a home on a closet shelf where it will stay unless i need a very small camera to chase action in a cross country race or similar event on a sunny day . otherwise , i \\'ll use the old sony so i can share the video i shoot without being embarrassed about the picture quality \\r\\n', ' i \\'m going to have to disagree with the majority of the reviews on this movie . i have seen plenty of russian films , and many of them have been slow and entirely reliant upon the emotional component . mikhalkov , for example , is a director who can do this . this movie suffers from pretentious screenwriting , and a lack of underlying meaning or moral lesson . although the acting is n\\'t necessarily bad , you do n\\'t get attached to the characters . i got the feeling that the cinematography and the colors did n\\'t match the movie \\'s theme and plot . at times it got so boring that i wanted to stop watching , even though i never do that . anyway , i do not recommend this movie . if you want to watch some good russian movies , go with \" brother \" , \" burnt by

the rythym section , utilize ( with supreme efficacy , i might add ) and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae \" riddims . \" on top of the radics , the wailing

after all no one i am afraid can bring the multi-layered world of words onto the screen . even those who loved the 1963 version would admit that . you can interpret the meaning of ` lord of the flies \\' but who can really visualize it , or the imaginary conversations of simon for that matter ? the biggest problem of harry hook \\'s new version is not the changes done to the film . the boys are american military school cadets , using dirty words frequently , but those parts did n\\'t annoy me much . real problem is something more essential to the film , which is storytelling . in short the 1990 film does n\\'t know what it wants to be . on the film \\'s video cover you can read ( and i quote ) ` this stunning adventure explores the deep dark corner of the human soul . \" well , not exactly . for as adventure story it lacks pace ; the film always feels rushed and often needs better editing . as allegory it needs more distinctive personalities for each character . the conflict between ralph and jack should be clearer , and piggy \\'s role should be more than that of a whining fat boy . and do n\\'t forget simon , who sees things , it is true , but definitely not those things that the film actually shows us . it is a pity that the cinematography is so beautiful . it could have been a perfect backdrop against which dark allegorical survival story would develop , opposite of optimistic tales of jules verne \\'s adventure stories . by watching this film you can follow the story of the book , but find no tension or thought-provoking words in it . balthazar getty

, say \" peace \" that occured in the new testament . the programs that come with it are nice as well , including one that tells you what to read if you want to read the bible in one year , the ot in one year , the nt in one year , and many more options . i was somewhat disappointed by a few features that would have made it a hands-down 5 star program , though . the original niv study bible has elaborate introductions for each book , including author , purpose , structure , and much more . the palm version is lacking all of this , and has no introduction at all . the original also has many cultural information boxes all throughout the bible , like a description of the differences between pharasees and sauducees ; the palm version does not . the cross references are wonderful - click on a small circle after a verse , and all of the cross references pop up . simply click on a cross reference , and the program takes you right there . unfortunately , however , the palm program has no feature like a \" back \" button that gets you back to the original text . finding your original spot is not difficult - it only takes 5 seconds and a little concentration - but would have been much nicer to go instantly back the same way you can instantly get to a cross refernce by clicking on it . finally , i would be actively marketing this product and the palm platform to all of my friends if it included all of the wonderful maps that the original has - maps of the holyland , jerusalem , the middle east , the temple , and others that are in my paper niv study bible . despite these flaws ,

manchurian candidate is a sluggish remake and updating of the 1962 classic starring frank sinatra . this film is a case study in why some movies should never be redone . this is a film that takes globalized issues and reduces them to personal jealousies . afraid to assert a viewpoint , the script meanders . denzel washington plays the sinatra role of ben markoe . he seems dazed on camera as though he is struggling to remember his lines . washington , normally a gifted actor , plays the part without any conviction whatsoever and uncharacteristically brings zero charisma to the role . markoe discovers that his gulf war comrade-in-arms , raymond shaw , soon to be the next vice-president of the united states , has been the subject of mind control experimentation by manchurian global , a vast multinational conglomerate . raymond 's handler is his senator mother ( meryl streep in the role of an ice queen ) . by diluting the threat from communism to capitalism , the producers lose sight of the most powerful elements of the story . after all , it is no great achievement to convince a major american political candidate to back big business , and so the grotesqueries of shaw 's brainwashing get lost against the backdrop , seeming less heinous than merely greedy , even when shaw becomes a programmed murderer at the hands of his avaricious , amoral , and possibly incestuous mother . why the film created the unlikely manchurian global corporation as the demon of the day and shied away from any real political controversy is indicative of the manchurian global mindset that has gripped hollywood . god forbid we should point a finger at mainland china ( or anyplace else ) ; it might reduce the bottom line . this film says more about its creators than about the threat it

hodge podge statements it tries to make . some of my favorite actors are wasted , either by being given cliched dialogue , over acting , or being put there merely for their brand name with no script

remind everyone how it started . among the top of my most over rated movies \\r\\n', ' this book was written in the \\' 80s was copy written in 1990. it has a folksy tone and some technical

under development \" . \\r\\n', \" it 's not because it 's so slow that i hate it , it 's because microsoft has decided that i 'm too stupid to know what i 'm doing so they 've decided to protect me from myself and wo n't allow me to even look at what 's on my hard drive . every mouse click now takes 3 or 4 clicks for the same thing . it 's so confusing to look at my documents folders , i ca n't figure out what is where . i ca n't view web pages on my own site because they are n't in the security frame of safe . all my usb wifi devices do n't work on vista and the only ones available are

done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity . in obtaining a bachelor \\'s degree in english , i had to read a lot of books . among them were many books that i did not like , but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety . every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along . people become pregnant , have abortions , and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens . this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing . the book does n\\'t flow naturally , you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows , playing the puppet master . there are just so many coincidences , so many old friends just happening to run into eachother , so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly , all of the characters vaguely , distantly connected to eachother . i do n\\'t want to spoil the plot , but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames ( rhymes with screams ) family is just too much coincidence to bear . it \\'s as though the author is god , and the characters completely lack free will . and then there \\'s the \" protagonist , \" homer wells . i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story , homer wells barely does anything in the story . he barely even speaks during the story . he is virtually a non-character , devoid of personality or will , around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve . the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all , and they make up the majority of the book , are without fail the most interesting scenes . i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr. larch , but even melony seems more real than homer does . the story is very long and rambling . subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on . minor characters keep popping into the story , then disappearing , only to pop back into the story exactly when they \\'re needed . conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten ( like the situation with debra pettigrew ) . after such a rambling , at times rather boring plot , the ending feels rather rushed . it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything , tie up every loose end , in the last 25 pages ( and tying up loose ends , in this case , means a lot of people conveniently dying ) . to spoil the plot just a little , homer wells , who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul , suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion . i personally am pro-choice as well , but i found that homer \\'s sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters \\r\\n', ' there is no way

watch her video . i find her way overrated . she does have some funny stuff . she \\'s got a particular knack for doing impressions , and there \\'s some other genuinely funny material . however , the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience . she does a lot of vulgar material , homosexual-oriented jokes , etc. that are clearly just there for the \" outlaw \" value . and she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she \\'s personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to

the hardware incompatibility issues w / the dvd-ram drive , the gl910 chipset , and the soundmax integrated audio drivers are known to both microsoft technical service personnel and their counterparts at toshiba . i spent an hour of fruitless time on a conference call with technicians from both companies ( both of whom spoke what could loosely be descibed as \" english \" ) . the amazon representative with whom i spoke was in new delhi . i ultimately figured out ( on my own ) which toshiba drivers needed to be downloaded ( again consuming hours of download time with a 56k modem ) ,

and most of all , if this is the author 's usual way of communicating his ideas , for his students . luckily , i did not buy this book ; for one person , who could not stand reading through it , dared me to finish his unfinished endeavor \\r\\n\", \" i did a lot of research before buying this camera . we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price . what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a 8cm dvd-r , finalize the disc on the camcorder , and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd-rom player on our computer . we did n't want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv , electrical outlet , and camera to playback footage . and we also did n't want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future . for those of you who like to edit , re-record , create effects , etc. , you need to purchase special software separately , but with a dvd-ram disc , you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd-rom on your computer . you can also download it with the usb cable , but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started . if you are only interested in playback , dvd-r discs are sufficient ; however , you ca n't erase or record over footage on dvd-rs , only dvd-rw and dvd-ram discs . the picture quality of the camera is adequate . it is n't grainy , but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting , especially outside on a sunny day . it does n't have a built-in light , so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording . i would give the picture quality a 3.75 out of 5. if you want better quality , you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder . considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology , it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy . you ca n't compare it to tv and movie camera quality , but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos . the zoom is good , but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly . the stabilizer is pretty good , but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality . if you plan to move around a lot , use the function , but expect to lose a little quality in the process . what basically happens when using the stabilizer ( with most cameras , i believe ) is that the image movements are slightly delayed . the sound quality is adequate , but if you are recording when it is windy , you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand . the only problem i have had so far is with the discs . we bought panasonic dvd-rw discs and ca n't get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player . we ended up purchasing sony dvd-r discs and they play with no problem . when i called panasonic about their dvd-rw discs , they did n't have a good answer . the representative told me to make sure the dvd-rw discs are compatible with my players . i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player , but it should be with my new computer software . the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there is n't any difference between sony and panasonic discs ( interesting ) . they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual , but now i know better . overall , this camcorder is a great value ( you ca n't beat the price for this dvd technology ) , average to good quality picture and functions , is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage , and is really easy to use . \\r\\n\", ' this book was recommended to me by several people as i interviewed hiring managers , hr personnel , senior-level employees , and others for my own book on the job market . by all accounts , my own included , 201 best questions is comprehensive , helpful , and tactical , an important read when one is preparing for an interview . it is not an all-inclusive resource , only interview-targeted , but for what it is , the book is top-notch \\r\\n', \" i was so excited when this dvd came out hoping to get the four pittsburgh steelers highlight films from the ' 70s . 98% of all this material is already included in the super bowl collection sets put out last year on dvd . why wo n't nfl films step up and give us more ? ? ? this should be a steeler-specific box set , not some rehash of the entire season for all teams.. . come on steve sabol ;

crook named gilbert bland who stole rare and irreplaceable maps in the \\' 90s . posing as a researcher , bland would enter rare-book collections and slice old maps out of antique atlases with a single-edged razor . then he would sell the maps to unsuspecting - - or at least unquestioning - - dealers . before being busted at the peabody library at johns hopkins university in baltimore , he had stolen more than a half million dollars \\' worth of maps . \" island \" is the first book for author miles harvey . in the book , he tries to pull together enough material on the crime and map collecting to create an appealing 350-page book . he is only partly successful . i found the material on bland \\'s crime fascinating . however , bland as a subject does not fill the entire 350 pages because his life is dull . unfortunately the author inflates incidents and descriptions to pad the text . i found myself skipping pages to get back to the crime . there is some interesting stuff about

will be utterly honest , i do n\\'t buy music cds anymore . with so many bands hitting the streets faster than i can imagine , i honestly cannot keep up with them all . music begins to sound the same

sound uniform , unoriginal , and overly drab . i had nearly lost my faith in music , retreating to some of my older music like dmb , counting crows , and travis , but then i found ... the suns . stumbling around the internet i discovered , shockingly , one of the videos to their album called \" romantic death \" . it was one of the most creative and disturbing videos that i have seen in quite some time . then it hit me , i could n\\'t get this song out of my mind . throughout the whole day i had the beat , the lyrics , and the overall sensation of the song stuck in my mind ... and i had only heard it once . like a drug , i needed more . when i returned home that evening i found the song again and could n\\'t stop listening to it . for the first time in a long time , i had found a new band . then , i bought this album . knowing nothing about the band except for the \" romantic death \" song , i put this in my dvd player and continued to be impressed . their videos are just as smart as their music . their tracks seem to cover every genre of music from folk , rock , and even hard edge . their lyrics seem well-considered , smart and a voice to a new generation . my favorites of the album are : \" must be you \" \" romantic death \" ( parental guidance is suggested ) \" lost at home \" \" rockstop \" \" we tried \" in fact , every time i listen to this album i find a new song to explore , a new song to jam to on the way to work ; a new song to enjoy ! for those skeptical of this band , i suggest this album to test your tastes . not only does it provide songs for you to burn onto other cds which allow friends and family to explore this band , but also all of their energetic , original videos that will never see the light of day on mtv , but can be watched from the leisure

show how good a book like \" breathing lessons \" is- -nothing extraordinary happens and yet i did not want to put the book down . there are no conspiracies to rule the world or cover up some dark secret . there are no car chases , explosions , sex scenes ( barely even any kissing ) , or exotic locations . no one changes or has an epiphany . almost nothing happens- -maggie and ira go to a funeral and when they come back they try to reunite their son and former daughter-in-law but nothing changes at all . to the average reader this book probably would seem really dull . heck , if someone told me the plot of this book i \\'d think it was really dull too , but i did n\\'t want to put it down . the reason is that maggie and ira are so well-drawn and so familiar to me that they seem like people i know or could know . i think i could go to the supermarket and run into maggie and ira , that \\'s how real they seemed to me . i suppose ther reason is that tyler allows me as the reader to know just about everything regarding these two characters and their two personalities just come through so transparently in the story that they do n\\'t seem like characters acting their parts ; they seem like real people . because of this , even though very little happens to maggie or ira and even though neither of them changes by the end of the book , i cared so much about them that i wanted to keep reading right through the end so i breezed through the novel in a few days . in all honesty , what i really appreciate about this book is that it seemingly disproves almost everything i \\'ve ever read about how to write a book . this is purely a character-driven novel with very little \" plot \" except for the death of maggie \\'s friend \\'s husband that gets the ball rolling . everything else seems to happen so naturally as an extension of maggie \\'s personality more than any artificially-generated plot twists . it \\'s hard for me to find any real faults with this book ,

observer will find it hard to look through ( very small eye opening ) , and will in most cases cause blurred images . the 20 mm eyepiece is the only functional eyepiece . the barlow is a 3x , which again is too poweerful for this scope . 3. the mount will vibrate when touched , which will cause the image in the eyepiece to \" shiver \" , which is very frustrating . even for the low price , do

for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below . this movie is not the epic , thought-provoking , intelligent sci fi i was led to believe it was . it \\'s actually very overrated , and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or primer will likely be very disappointed . the first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping . i was really getting geared up for what i was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites . the scenes of bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet , driving around a mall , the sun rising to the haunting score- -all unforgettable . the scenes where bruno starts to lose it , running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun , setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he \\'s their ruler , giving them speeches ( that \\'s why i deserve to be president...of the quiet earth...i \\'ve been condemned to live ) are all great . after this point the movie starts to disintegrate , and quickly . the female character is highly irritating , so much so that i think i would have ditched her and looked for other survivors . api is also highly irritating , and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle- -my thumbs were pointing down , way down . something needs to be said about the ending of this film . so many people have said that it \\'s \" deep . \" how is it \" deep ? \" how is it deep when it \\'s just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really does n\\'t have anything to say ? let \\'s examine this . many people argue the following ( and if they were correct the film would \\'ve been much better than it was ) : the main character is a scientist who convinces himself that project flashlight resulted in \" the effect \" ( even though others here insist on calling it \" the event \" ) which made everyone else disappear . the main characters come to believe that \" the effect \" did n\\'t snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened . but what if there is n\\'t any \" effect \" at all ? what if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there are n\\'t any people ? the scientist then convinces himself that \" the effect \" is going to happen again , and , understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers , daffy , annoying woman and a nutty , homicidal maniac , decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for project flashlight . he dies again and ends up on another world , one which this time does n\\'t even resemble earth . the end . it would have been very clever if this was what was going on , if there really was n\\'t an \" effect \" at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died . unfortunately , all the critics saying \" they went to another earth where everyone else was gone \" are forgetting something : the dead bodies ! i know there are n\\'t a lot , but remember , there \\'s the radiation burn guy in the science station , and there \\'s the dead guy on the hood of his car , and the dead woman holding a cb radio , etc. if they went to another earth where life was absent , why are there dead people ? the real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out , that it does n\\'t make sense , and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive . according to the people who worked on the film , \" the effect \" obviously did occur , and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies , again , at the exact moment that \" the effect \" occurs a second time . so at the end , \" the effect \" does occur a second time , which means the girl and api are history , and the scientist , as he again dies when \" the effect \" occurs , moves on one more time . another point that is made in the dvd commentary is that the film was made by a catholic , so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind . also highly irritating is that for a scientist , the main character is not very smart . he laments that he \\'s the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman . they find a nutty guy named api and then the three of them conclude they \\'re the last three people on earth ! what ? ! are they totally daft ? a scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city , more people than that throughout the rest of new zealand , and even more people in bigger places such as america , europe , and asia . that his first conclusion is always that \" they \\'re the only ones \" only demonstrates his stupidity . they come to believe that they all died at the same time , right when \" the effect \" occurred , and that that \\'s why they remained on earth . well , if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny new zealand , then many , many other people must \\'ve died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world . \\r\\n', ' have been using acrobat since v3 , v4 , v6. v8 is in line . seems

. many women with hg cannot get to another room of the house without help , much less drive a car to a spa ! hg is a disease and not a psychological condition . women cannot stop the disease at will .

hoping to have the same experience , and lately have been sorely disappointed . \" the virgin \\'s lover \" fell flat , and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged , must give

amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed . that may or may not be the case with gregory . i know , as a writer myself , that there are times when the work flows out , feeling almost as if it \\'s channeled from another source , and times when it \\'s harder , more mechanical . the more challenging situations are those when i \\'m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject . so

do n't expect to view your photos at the 16:9 ratio without some work in a photo manipulation program . what does that mean you ask ? that means that your photos wo n't fill the entire screen in the 4:3 mode . you will have 2 black bars on either side of your images ; this will not take advantage of the entire frame . if you switch to the 16:9 mode your images will stretch to the width of the frame , making peoples faces distorted . i have a workaround for those who are familiar with image manipulation . see below . the build quality of the frame is pretty good . if mustek would fix the 16:9 problem and get a better quality screen , this would be a nice little frame . a little work is evolved setting up the pictures for the 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches the image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate for the stretch and make your images appear normal . i set up a macro in photoshop allowing me to do a batch in one click of the mouse . you will just need to keep an eye out on how it crops the image . some of your images might be better served one at a time . start with an image that is 1024x768 in your image editing program . 1. go to the image size menu and change the width of the image to 77% ( or 788 pixels ) this will make the image look distorted . that is ok . 2. then go to the canvas size menu and crop the height of the image to 77% ( or 591 pixels ) the image is ready to save . you might want to save as in to another folder so you can go back to your original if needed . 3. copy your edited images on to the flash card and

while he was on vacation too . i went to my local cofee place and got a medium regular cofee flavored cofee but in a large cup ( so theres room for plenty of milk which i like and also you only get charged for a medium even though its in a large ) . anyway i am reading this book and it seems okay but then this guy with a laptop bumps into my chair where i have rested my cofee which is not at all my fault because thats why the chair has a little ledge there . so then this guy says he is sorry but that doesnt exactly unspil my cofee if you catch my meaning . and he offers to pay for a new cofee but it doesnt really matter its the principle of the thing . anyway then he leaves and i notice my copy of the book has cofee spilled on it not just my pants as i thought previously . so i \\'m not about to read a book with cofee stains all over it so i take it back to the library . now here i have to point out that i had a little incident a couple weeks back with the librarian and long story short they lost a book about a fireman that i returned and made me pay for it but not without a fight . well you better believe that same librarian who yelled at me is watching me now whenever i go in there and she sees that cofee stain right off when i turn the book in . i explain that its still perfectly good and you can still read it and it wasnt even my fault and maybe they should get the $8.50 from the cofee house they made the cofee not me . but you can guess how this ended up . i am down another $8 dollars and change ( i paid the .50 cents in pennies i got from the place i keep pennies in the car which got me a cross look since i counted them out one by one but it was worth it ) . and i never finished the book since it was ruined . but ! i liked the parts i read \" okay \" and if the

nile river . through a combination of bad luck , poor planning , disease , weather , natives , etc. , livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika . henry stanley , a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher . this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place . the perils of african exploration in the late 19th century cannot be overstated . this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader . i found this book very similar in style and experience to

depressing movies i \\'ve ever seen . to be clear : i \\'ve seen movies like , oh , say , \" schindler \\'s list , \" or \" the heart is a lonely hunter \" that treat tragic events , either in the macrocosm or the microcosm , that did not leave me depressed . rather , they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think . \" house of mirth \" deals with tragic themes , including human society \\'s ability to destroy its own , and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites . it was n\\'t , though , moving or thought provoking . i was n\\'t moved by gillian anderson \\'s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . i did n\\'t believe gillain anderson \\'s portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor . rather , i was bored . i kept wanting the film to go faster . it \\'s a great irony ; edith wharton \\'s novels are real page turners . quick , to the point . hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality . \" house of mirth \" has gorgeous clothing and sets . i did n\\'t care about anybody onscreen , though . i did n\\'t believe anybody onscreen . i felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda , and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces , as if to prove these points : people are hypocrites , see ! people are insincere , see ! if a person has any decency at all , that person is destroyed , see ! i would tend to agree with all of the above points . so ... why do i need to watch this movie ? also , as a woman , who , as lily bart was meant to , has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that , i felt that this movie , no less than the polite society it depicts so brutally , betrayed lily bart . lily bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film . she all but participates in her own destruction . you want , just once , for her to show some initiative , some intelligence , some ability to create her own fate . the film denies her those abilities . in this crippling of lily bart , the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does . movies like \" gone with the wind \" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning , and occasionally gaining some power , imo , are much easier to watch . one might argue that such films are not realisitic . i do n\\'t know . even we real-life lily barts have our resources , and our triumphs . and , again , watching lily bart in \" house of mirth \" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me . it was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine . \\r\\n', ' having an m.a. in english literature as well as a b.a. in literature and history , anytime a movie is both historical and literary . . . well , i get a bit excited to say the least . i do n\\'t wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it \\'s not , but the writers / directors / producers set it against a \" historical \" backdrop nonetheless . on that note , this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott . with that being said , i enjoyed \" tristan and isolde \" almost as much as \" gladiator \" and a bit more than \" kingdom of heaven \" ( all of these , by the way , are ridley scott films ) . notice the historical adaptations here ? while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare \\'s \" romeo and juliet \" as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend , this movie is not exclusively for the high-browed college types . no sir , good ol \\' red-blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie . this is by no means a \" chick flick \" since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense . on the other hand , it \\'s not the typical \" hack and slash \" macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story . in short , it should please both sexes simultaneously . aside from james franco ( tristan ) , i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast . sophia myles ( isolde ) is , for the most part , a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films . i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic . while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles , no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king ( who just so happens to be isolde \\'s father ) . in short , this is one of the best movies i \\'ve seen in awhile . on some levels it reminds me of \" king arthur . \" just as \" king arthur \" attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur , guinevere , and lancelot , so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england . if you \\'ll recall in \" king arthur , \" arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia . historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal , but oh well . . . it made for a good story . here , we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea . what ? ? ? ? the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around ? well , \" tristan and isolde \" holds true to history in this aspect ; namely , that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo-saxons . this would , of course , have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall . and this is exactly where the movie is set . let \\'s not forget the story of saint patrick . remember , he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity . it \\'s interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new-fangled religion in ireland , so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand . i particulary liked \" king arthur \" and \" kingdom of heaven \" despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics . critically speaking , \" tristan and isolde \" has been a bit of a mixed bag as well- --but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics ? rent it first if you must , but i suspect this one will be a \" keeper \" in your dvd library ! \\r\\n', \" i did n't think i would like the fragrance , but it 's absolutely wonderful . it 's not too sweet or strong . it smells good on my

anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants are among the best-selling medications on the market . the everyday stressors faced by americans have simply become too much for many to bear , and reasonably so . in recent years , taking an anti-anxiety medication or antidepressant has become as common as taking a multivitamin . however , the side effects and long-term effects of such medications were for the most part unknown until recently . in the past year , some of the drastic negative effects of such medications have come to light , much to the horror of patients and physicians alike . anti-anxiety medications and antidepressants have been linked to addiction , severe withdrawal , weight gain , vertigo , and even suicide and death . to treat the symptoms of stress , anxiety , and depression , without negative health implications , many are now turning to natural supplements - - safely and with much success . most consumers are confused about which natural stress , anxiety , and depression supplements to take . fortunately , there are now a few promising natural supplements on the market which offer truly effective results , safely . the challenge lies in distinguishing the effective products from the one 's that are based more on marketing hype . it is critical that the product you choose contains those ingredients proven effective for treatment through clinical study , and that those ingredients are of the highest grade and included in the proper dosage in the product . this is the key to getting the results you desire - freedom from stress , anxiety , and depression . after researching nearly every available natural anxiety product on the market today i can tell you that many products contain low-grade ingredients in amounts far too small to be truly effective . there are a few , however , with clinical research behind them that also contain quality ingredients in efficacious doses . these products offer the definite potential to counter your emotional and physical responses to stress , anxiety , and depression . after review of the products and the available scientific literature only those products that met the criteria were recommended , here is a list of the top the top 10 stress , anxiety and depression supplements on the market today : 1 ) anxietol 7 ( tm ) 2 ) welatonin ( tm ) 3 ) pinadol ( tm ) 4 ) seredyn ( tm ) 5

lennon / mccartney-caliber teamwork was lost . not that moorer sounds like the beatles , but allison and butch complemented each other well when composing music . this cd is not only unmemorable but i

say this , but i cannot recommend this cd . the closest analogy i can think of that relates to how different this cd is from her earlier work is the b-story line from an episode of \" the larry

was so good - - a little edgy , sad , sometimes bitter , or at least that \\'s how i interpreted it . granted , that was n\\'t her entire oeuvre , but it is what made her songs special for me . now

william hogeland attempts create a revisionist history of the late eighteenth century whiskey rebellion in western pennsylvania . what hogeland accomplishes is less history and more diatribe in the vein of howard zinn . he has an axe to grind , and by the end alexander hamilton is the devil incarnate , and those who openly contemplated secession and committed acts of violence against property and people were just trying to bring the american revolution to its necessary conclusion . the accusation that hogeland comes back to again and again is that hamilton incited the rebellion . the argument is that because hamilton 's patently unfair whiskey tax was the impetus behind the frontiersmen 's resistance , and his unreasonableness in enforcing the tax and issuing writs for the arrest of those who refused to pay the tax caused the rebellion . the problem with hogeland 's argument is his scholarship , or lack there of . he almost never offers a direct quote , especially when accusing hamilton of malfeasance . instead , hogeland offers his summary of primary documents with nary a footnote . the reader is expected to accept on faith the author 's interpretation at face value with no way to check the facts except a ridiculously useless bibliographic essay at the end . not all of this is hogeland 's fault . the new trend in historical works intended for the popular market eschews scholarly footnoting , opting instead for endnotes that provide little more than an opportunity to name drop . even doris kearns goodwin , a legitimate scholar , is guilty of the succumbing to this new endnote craze . ultimately , this is the main problem with william hogeland : he is not a scholar . he is a magazine writer with an agenda , and no scholarly background to legitimize his preposterous conclusions . to read some radical agenda into the actions of the pennsylvania farmers is the very worst revisionist history , because there is no basis in reality .

. this is the book that broke the dispensationalist view of the end times into the consciousness of america . a phemomenal best seller , it was a watershed event in the growing christian publishing industry . for many christians , their first reading of this book was an energizing event that shaped their future . a generation later , many of its former supporters now see in its pages a complete misreading of holy scripture , sensationalistic attempts to correspond biblical prophecies to current events , and an unhealthy enthusiasm for seeing the world obliterated . so why bother with what can easily be written off as paranoid millenarianism ? well , while many have outgrown its simplistic approach to world events , it still resounds for much of the church and this is shown in the continued audience for books by lindsey and other \" prophecy pundits . \" while it is certainly true that tim lahaye has replaced lindsey as the popular voice of dispensationalism , it cannot be denied that left behind was made possible by this book . part of the commercial success of both authors has to do with their placing the dispensationalist view in a popular book form . for lahaye and jerry b . jenkins , it was the pulp novel . back in 1970 , lindsay and c . c . carlson did the same with a popular genre of their day - the sensationalistic expose . like most books of this type ( e.g. , the bermuda triangle , chariots of the gods ? , the philadelphia experiment , the population bomb ) , it is written in a breezy soundbite style that is long on conjecture and short on facts . like most of these books , it was a peculiar period piece of american life at a time when the fabric of the nation seemed to be coming apart at the seams . like most of these books , it is laughable in retrospect . if the book were out of circulation and i were reviewing this for historical purposes , i would almost be tempted to give it a free pass as a kitschy period piece...sort of a fundamentalist lava lamp . the original was so over the top and written with such enthusiasm one could almost have forgiven the fact that the authors got everything wrong . after all , it was the 1970 \\'s when wild conspiracy theories , distrust of any traditional authority , and predictions of impending disaster were all the rage . when viewed within a time frame that produced predictions of a soon to be ice age , a ufo invasion , a famine around the corner , and california falling into the pacific ocean , the authors \\' claims of the coming armageddon look downright trendy . however , in the intervening years , the revisions of this book just kept piling up . make a bad prediction ? no problem , edit the book with the old gaffes removed , add a few trendier predictions , and release it as a new book . lindsey , now well into middle age and hurtling towards his golden years , still clings to the long discredited dispensationalist hypothesis ( carleton \\'s contribution is more stylistic ) despite his failed scenarios . lindsey \\'s original view was that the end times events would take place in the 1980s ( he even wrote a book the 1980\\'s : countdown to armageddon trumpeting this belief ) . well that did n\\'t pan out , so he then jumped on the y2k bandwagon ( another of his books was planet earth 2000 a.d. : will mankind survive ? ) . oops , wrong again . first communism was the main source of evil in the world but more recently it is islam ( a more recent book is the everlasting hatred : the roots of jihad ) . when one bogeyman falls , he is quick to insert a new one in its place . between the failed predictions , the hilarious misreadings of the original languages , the bizarre correlations between apocalyptic symbolism and modern military technology , and the hysterical pleading for contemporary events fulfilling the biblical prophecies \" right before our eyes \" , it is not surprising many of those energized by this book became convinced of the imminent end of all things . this trend continues to this day for the many followers of dispensationalist worldview as they are perpetuated in the many novels based on dispensationalist beliefs - notably the left behind series of novels . if you can find a copy of the original version from 1970 , it can be interesting in much the same way as a brady bunch episode - not for its merit but as an example of a particular moment in the consciousness of the fundamentalist subculture at a particular time . just as many catholics have vivid memories of nuns and the baltimore catechism , fundamentalists of that era will never forget this book and the movie a thief in the night . however , for the reedited version here presented as a guide to interpreting biblical prophecy , it is best to pass . for all its success as a cultural marker , its usefulness in properly understanding biblical prophecy is basically nil . for this , its original purpose , the late great planet earth is completely worthless . \\r\\n', ' appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget , cgi enhanced anime theatrical releases have : gorgeous visuals , but a incomprehensible

the camera got persnickety , often demanding upon startup that i restart it . now that the camera has completely broken down , with the lens fully extended and stuck in place , i think this was a sign of a too-delicate lens mechanism that was beginning to deteriorate . another durability issue concerns the finish : the plastic coating on the 4-way rocker switch on the back that controls image review , flash , etc. , quickly wore off , and there are other small scratches all over the body of the camera . not a big deal in itself , but annoying given the other problem . the lens is prone to strange flaring , especially indoors , where lights in the room often up as large white blotches at various points of the frame . several photos were ruined , or have required tedious photoshopping . otherwise , the lens is fine and reasonably sharp , although nothing to write home about . the camera seems to hunt for autofocus lock more than some comparable models , e.g. , canon a610. many frames are motion-blurred , as well . there are ways to avoid this , but i did n't buy a point-n-shoot with fiddly controls and menus in order to mess around with aperture-priority exposure , thank you . there are a few things to recommend it : not only is it relatively inexpensive , it has a lens significantly wider than the competition- -31 or 32mm equivalent vs. 35mm . those few mm 's make a big difference when you ca n't move back far enough to get everything in the frame . it is also quick in its operations ( except when hunting for focus , see above . ) the jpegs it cranks out are extremely colorful- -bright red so much so that details sometimes seems to be lost- -but generally everything looks good . skintones are good . still , with the durability issue , this one 's not

could actually see what was going on more clearly . on second thought , given that this predictable film was little more than 100 minutes of \" shoot the mutants \" , it \\'s pretty clear that mr. bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment . as to the film \\'s plot , it can be summarized in a single sentence : a group of ï¿½ber-soldiers lead by their \" sarge \" ( played by the rock ) travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh-eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig . so , there \\'s tons of shooting , a lot of screams , gallons of fake blood & guts being tossed about , a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small-scale version of \" the sphere \" . others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban ( ï¿½ber-soldier john grimm ) and rosamund pike

deliver the flavor punch of pure butter . so i was a little skeptical , and then reading through the recipes , although they are very clearly written , there are n\\'t a lot of extra tips on technique or anything for individual recipes . the book already assumes a level of competence . i made three recipes from the book : the essential chewy sugar cookie , the essential chewy chocolate chip cookie

this is no longer the eleventh century where protestants are killing catholics . the only people k / illing in the name of religion are fanatical muslims , but most religious people are good , decent , nonviolent individuals . maher \\'s not an atheist , but he has recently expressed a \" could be , could be not \" attitude toward the existence of a g / od , which would make him agnostic . but one thing is for sure , atheism has more blood on its hands than religion does . two of our biggest mass murderers- -hitler and stalin- -were atheist . it \\'s a shame when non comedians are actually funnier than maher , who wears the comedian label but is too bitter to be a good one . most of the time , he can barely get the joke out without laughing at himself . i laughed twice during the entire show . no one has ever accused maher of being modest . he \\'s a smug , intellectual elitist . and those are his good qualities . \" i \\'m swiss \" displays this all too clearly . in case you did n\\'t know , \" i \\'m swiss \" is a running joke of maher \\'s embarrassment of being an american . he \\'d rather belong to a country where ethics are a substitution for , not an extension of , morality ; where any depraved activity that has no victim is not immoral at all ; where adultery is seen as cute , not sinful ; where there are no fat people ; where the only women who exist are the pretty ones he can sleep with or the ugly ones who agree with his opinions . thank god i live in america and not switzerland . \\r\\n', \" i did n't even want to see this movie , but my brother read the book and wanted to see it .

manage a day \\'s worth of shooting with two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier to connect to computer or tv . if you have a good computer with a firewire port , please buy a firewire cable to connect the camcorder to your computer . you can download your movie in excellent clarity in .avi format and edit it as required - make sure to change the audio setting to 16 bit ( instead of the default 12 bit ) for very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system is great . you do n\\'t have to search for any buttons as they are all available in the touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom is more than sufficient for ordinary home videos . anything more produces more \" shaking \" and would necessiate the use of a tripod . when you shoot without a tripod , 10x is the best zoom you can achieve without worrying about shaky videos - widescreen still photo . the photo clarity is ok not too good . so please do n\\'t expect great shots . since the photo is in 16:9 format , you can take panoramic photos and cover more people in group shots - nightshot : cool feature that records using infrared light . useful for shooting at night as you can record a video even in 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you are running down on batteries and need to use the viewfinder . the color widescreen viewfinder gives an excellent picture and is as good as the lcd in clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially in bright sunlight are overexposed . so please adjust the white balance when shooting outdoors . add the white-balance menu to your shortcuts so that you can easily access it and return to default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best to turn off the button click \" beep \" sound ) . notes : - use a fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times on the same cassette . the head tends to get dirty if you re-record on the same cassette more than 3 times - you can edit movies in windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it does not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly as you shot them in 16:9 but movie maker converted it to 4:3. invest in pinnacle software version 9 or 10 for better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle is the only software , i am aware of , that preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you can also invest in wide-angle lens as it gives excellent coverage \\r\\n', \" sure , the pacing is slow compared to today 's hyper / cyber entertainments , but antonioni 's

fixed and reading countless reviews of similar problems . something bad will happen to this camera . either the sceen will break or the memory card thing . a friend of mine also owned the s410 , and

course of my 37 yrs who perk up at the mention of it to be aware of its place in a lot of our memories . this has been satirized on the simpsons , which proves it has embedded itself in the national pop culture consciousness . anyone who has read the book its based on , the incredible \" i am legend \" by richard matheson , knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its intial premise- -and even that is not followed too closely . all of the criticisms of the omega man are valid : it is very dated and not at all scary or intense and some of the stunts and special effects are laughably , ludicrously cheesy ; the villains- -who should have been more terrifying than even romero \\'s zombies- -are just crazed albino hippie luddites and the last half of the film , once chuck hooks up with rosalind cash and the kiddies , is really a let down . but the scenes that open the film of heston hefting a cool-looking machine gun while decked out in austin powers-style finery ( ! ) staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch . this was the second movie , after 1959 \\'s the world , the flesh , and the devil , to successfully pull off the eerie effect of being the last living human being in a huge empty city . both films established the visual motif of streets filled with blowing waves of newspapers and swirling trash.after years of seeing this on tv - - a guaranteed late september or early october event every year for a few years on the local tv station during my

between commercially acceptable and just plain commercial . this is the first time he fell off and became just plain commercial . a disco-esque record , it 's remembered more fondly than it was received by bowie fans at the time . it has some good moments , but overall the production is just too slick and there 's a dearth of imagination on it - china girl is an old iggy pop song , cat people is just a newer version of a previous single and criminal world is a cover of a song by metro , meaning there 's a grand total of five new songs on it . china girl proves a perfect foil for bowie 's melodramatic vocals , cat people is still great even when smothered in too much production and modern love proves that you 're ( nearly ) always gonna get at least one classic on a bowie

( in a quote below , you will see that dennett puts free will in a list of things people belief in . ) it is not clear from the book whether dennett is a materialist , but he is certainly a naturalist . concerning the proof of god \\'s existence , he trots out david hume \\'s \" who made god ? \" which is based on a misunderstanding of the principle of causality . i refer the reader to my personal website for my version of the proof . let \\'s look at two quotes , the first is at the end of the chapter \" belief in belief \" and the other at the beginning of the chapter \" morality and religion \" : \" that is , is n\\'t it true that , whether or not god exists , religious belief is at least as important as the belief in democracy , in the rule of law , in free will ? the very widespread ( but far from universal ) opinion is that religion is the bulwark of morality and meaning . \" ( p . 245 ) \" without the divine carrot and stick , goes this reasoning , people would loll about aimlessly or indulge their basest desires , beak their promises , cheat on their spouses , neglect their duties , and so on . there are two well-known problems with this reasoning : ( 1 ) it does n\\'t seem to be true , which is good news , since ( 2 ) is is such a demeaning view of human nature . \" ( p . 279 ) in the first chapter , he mentions \" bulwark of morality \" and \" meaning . \" but in the second chapter , he leaves out \" meaning . \" if our purpose in life is not to get to heaven , what is our purpose is life ? whether religion supports morality can be determined by observing whether there is a correlation of moral conduct with religious belief . mr. dennett makes such a correlation to the detriment of religion by citing the high divorce rate of fundamentalist christians . there are worse things than divorcing your spouse . disingenuousness can be worse and can take the form of leaving unsaid what should have been said . mr. dennett should have explained why he did not discuss the idea that religion gives meaning to life . the only miracle mentioned in mr. dennett \\'s book is the shroud of turin , which has on it a mysterious image of a crucified man . since no one claims to know how the image got there , it can be called a miracle . however , mr. dennett does not tell us anything about it . the reader is left to find out about the famous relic by

the plot of this twenty first century movie carry identical messages . the movie is an eloquent cinematic adaptation of the novel that gives dostoevsky \\'s central character a new breath of life from the modern day perspective . the movie attempts to survey the convoluted mind of a building inspector through a video-taped self confession . the psychological similarities between the character in dostoevsky \\'s novel and the building supervisor in the movie are uncanny . both characters share a state of mind that is the epitome of a human condition where miserable anti hero attitude reigns through a heightened level consciousness and the rationality of everyday living through action is put to rest . the character in the movie who identifies himself as a \" sick man , a spiteful man \" lives his life in isolation by the drowning himself into the puddle of his own conflicting thoughts . he despises his friends and at the same time he seems eager to improve his relationship with them . the character in the movie voluntarily creates unpleasant scenarios that trigger his eventual self demise . he often finds himself confined within the conflicting walls of his consciousness . he falls in love with a prostitute but at the same time he is utterly disgusted by her profession and tries to dominate her . by escalating the level of his thought process well above the habitual human awareness , the central character of the movie isolates himself from the crowd that dostoevsky \\'s narrator identifies as the \" men of action \" . the building supervisor is paralyzed by the own consciousness just like the narrator in dostoevsky \\'s novel . dostoevsky \\'s novel and the movie helps us realize that the collective standard of self-consciousness that the society forces us to adapt through a methodical process of uniformity and conformity , has a negative side effect that is strong enough to paralyze our lives and inflict a profound sense of alienation in our minds .

distractions and tools obtained . it might be interesting if that level of graphics and animation was worked into the game . the younger kids may be better able to intergrate a multi-tooled ,

found this book to be surprisingly easy to learn from . it smoothly and concisely guides the reader through the key elements of piano playing , starting with one-hand playing , but quickly to two-hands , then chords , etc. , and ending with sharp and flat notes . it is well organized , has well thought out exercises , advices , and a diverse collection of ( short ) attractive tunes of increasing complexity ( from jingle bells to waltzing matilda to silent night to green sleeves to we shall overcome to minuet in g minor ) . i prefer it to other teach-yourself piano books that take much longer to cover the same skills , such as the complete piano player or piano for dummies . i particularly like that it gets to two-hand playing almost right away , which i feel is better preparation- -even if it feels hard and slows the playing initially . it may have helped ( coordination-wise ) that i have been typing for 20+ years with both hands . if you are looking for a book that teaches all the essentials of basic piano playing in a thoughtful and concise way , then i recommend this book . if you perfer a slower pace , then maybe look elsewhere . for me , this was the perfect book to learn from . \\r\\n', ' i have used synmatec products for many years and have been fairly pleased by them . however , do n\\'t buy the upgrade or renew your subscription until after

quality , versatile product selling at a bargain price . this is not . i was hoping the same of this product from all the \" glowing \" reviews on here . however , this quality of this monopod is very disappointing . first of all , you have to ask yourself , why do you need a monopod over a tripod ? for myself and most , it \\'s because we need some stability and portability for our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms are long and heavy so the monopod should be designed strong and solid to live up to the task . this monopod does n\\'t even come close . here are it \\'s bad points : -the aluminum construction is very cheap quality . the leg segments wobble laterally when you extend and close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum and the monopod feels it could break in half like a toothpick at any time . -the head is very cheap and not solid . no matter how tight i tightened the head , my camera would slope down . the workmanship of the head is so cheap that at any point , you think that you \\'re going to break the plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we \\'ve all experienced that in the past . -the leg locks are not tight . when you push down on the monopod , the leg segments slide back into themselves . in the end , it was a risk i took hoping that i could get a high-quality product for a cheap price . sometimes , you can get away with that . walmart sells a very decent functioning tripod for only $30. in this case , i should \\'ve bought a real monopod . oh well , i wasted $16 that i could \\'ve used to help pay for a higher quality monopod \\r\\n', ' i was intrigued by \" satan \\'s little helper \" due to several things namely its halloween theme , which i \\'m a big sucker for , and the heralded return of jeff lieberman to the horror scene . lieberman made 4 minor cult horror films in the 70 \\'s and 80 \\'s , the last one being 1987 \\'s \" remote control \" . you would think that lieberman , with all this time off from filmmaking would have spent his share of time carefully observing horror films in order to craft a good one when he would choose to return . well , it almost feels like lieberman is stuck in some kind of time warp , as this movie looks like it came straight from the 80 \\'s due to how cheesy , trashy , cheap and godawful it is . many , myself included , look upon the 80 \\'s slasher craze with fond nostalgia but this is one film that reminds us how truly bad some of those films could be . the \" plot \" revolves around a 10-year old boy who is a huge fan of the video game \" satan \\'s little helper \" . it \\'s now halloween season and his mom buys him a devil costume , which he wears proudly . one afternoon , he spots a tall man wearing an equally devilish costume dragging bodies around to serve as halloween decoration stiffs for the front of his house . he becomes enamored with the tall & mute masked man and asks him if he can be his helper . the two then go on a rampage throughout the small suburban community , as the masked man kills people randomly in gruesome fashion all the while the boy ( whose intelligence quotient appears to be much closer to a 5-year old than a 10-year old ) inexplicably thinks it \\'s all still a game of make believe . if you think the plot sounds bad that \\'s nothing compared to how poorly this movie is executed . nearly everything about it is god-awful from the camcorder film quality , to the laughable gore effects ( including the least-ever convincing intestines i \\'ve ever seen ) and especially , the acting . the 10-year old boy , who appears in nearly every scene , makes a run for most annoying child actor in recent memory . the acting on just about everyone \\'s part is bad , and the characters all come across as being mentally retarded from the clueless boy to the mute villain who kills for no apparent or explained reason , the flaky sister and the eccentric , kooky mother . there is not a single character we can give a darn about and we do n\\'t care the least bit when someone gets killed . granted , dumb characters who do dumb things in horror movies are a dime a dozen , but these ones truly take the cake . i \\'m a little baffled as to why this movie has gotten its share of enthusiastic reviews . i \\'m thinking some people are going to put this in the \" so good it \\'s bad \" category but i \\'m not having it . some of the scenes in the movie that were meant to be \" funny \" , such as the parking lot scene where the villain and boy knock off a pregnant woman , an elderly lady , and a stroller carrying a kid , are downright appalling . the villain himself is a bad joke , as he does n\\'t utter a single word throughout the film , instead delivering thumbs-up signs to the kid and wagging his finger . cheesy ? heck , this film is cheesier than a black diamond factory . \" satan \\'s little helper \" comes across as the work of a first-time wannabe horror amateur with no budget , not something from a guy in his fifties considered a cult filmmaker . to sum up how i feel about this film , i will repeat a line that i see all over amazon that i usually feel redundant but somehow i find to be entirely fitting for this movie . do not rent or buy this garbage ! ! \\r\\n', \" i 've found the omron very easy and practical to use . it gives very good estimates of body fat

( the fbi put an end to organized gangs that robbed banks in the 1940s . ) this federal agency does n\\'t interfere because they want more information on their aims ( and their leaders ) . more terrorism is planned : dynamiting a courthouse , attacking a power station , etc. the terrorist plots here would keep this small group busy 24 hours a day ! kathy finds a secret list of \" friends \" . this is quickly copied with a camera . the federal agents need to know who this group will target so they can arrest them . gary meets with the leader ( who arrives in a helicopter ! ) and shows documents that say kathy is a special investigator . is kathy being served up as a sacrifice ? gary and kathy travel to chicago , where an assassination is planned that will make gary the fall guy .

' tighten up your wing ' is an upbeat , bluesy track , that bounces well along , before being replaced with ' none of your doing ' , a steppenwolf-classic , that shifts gear between verse & chorus . ' spiritual fantasy ' is one of the strangest creations on the album , strangely touching , though appaling at first . but given a second chance , it comes across as one of the best tracks on the album . the marihuana-anthem ' do n't step on the grass , sam ' is pure heavy steppenwolf , a timeless classic , that crunches slowly , but steadily along . ' 28 ' is a great rock song with just a hint of psychedelia in the melody . a neat little rocker that is followed by the ultimate psychedelic dance track . ' magic carpet ride ' is simply steppenwolf 's best song ever , a fantastic blend of rhytm , melody & vision , that is worth the price of all steppenwolf 's classic albums on its own . it was also the only of their singles to almost replicate ' born to be wild 's us #2 placing , when it shot to #3 on the us chart . ' disappointment number ' is almost that , but then not again . it is an odd ode to / parody of old blues , complete with bird sounds in the background , as if it 's an old blues singer sitting out in the open . ' lost and found by trial and error ' has a great tune , and rocks away well , as does ' hodge , podge , strained through a leslie ' and ' resurrection' . both employ the classic steppenwolf sound in a great rocking way , to become , if not classics , then at least steppenwolf-standards . the album closes with ' reflections ' a weird song , that seems like somebody trying to be visionary , before you realize that that is just what he is . just in a very peculiar way . the album has some , if not weak , then not too powerful spots , but generally it is a more than worthy follow-up to the first steppenwolf album , with a great blend of the band 's traditional hard rock and a form of psychedelia that suits them perfectly . even the least interesting tracks rock nicely , & no-one should have

claude vonstroke next , and then it 's into the m.a.n.d.y. remix of tiefschwarz 's excellent track damage , featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals . two solid tech house tracks follow , especially touane 's snappy track bassic , and it 's right into the gritty , churning , techno sound of thomas schumacher 's incredible track rotor . the mix then hits a very slight snag in track 7 , which i feel is one of only two so-so parts of the mix . it 's not bad , it 's just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking . it 's quickly forgotten as the mix races through

the author would discuss his use of sound , for which he is allegedly noted . as i purchased this book at the same time and had nothing else to read , i thought i \\'d give it a try . the book did start out with a brief discussion of some of his \" research \" and i thought that , perhaps , this book might actually have some real substance . that belief ; however , quickly disappeared . by the time i had reached the half-way point in the book , nothing remained but a schizophrenic quagmire of incomprehensible gibberish . how does total garbage like this manage to get printed ? ! there are those that claim that monroe was a highly left-brained individual who delved into the realm of the creative right-brain . if this book is any indication , one ca n\\'t help but wonder if monroe was missing his entire left hemisphere ! there is nothing logical or , for that matter , even coherent in the babble spewed across the endless pages of this book . it would have been worthwhile if monroe had actually described his experiments and resulting data in a scientific manner . instead , he chose to spew his incoherent ramblings about his own , personal , dream experiences : these wander so aimlessly , from paragraph to paragraph , that one ca n\\'t help but wonder what real point , if any , he was trying to make . the really sad thing is that i had really hoped to find a genuinely scientific study of his work - i was actually quite interested in the topic . having now been subjected to two of his useless books , i \\'m amazed that they \\'re still in print . this is

house by the cemetery . fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two-thirds of the movie , only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes . house by the cemetery is about an researcher ( whose work is never specified ) who moves his wife and his kid into a house in massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress . the titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy and their son bob move in despite a lot of bad signs , like the boarded-up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a dr. jacob tess freudstein in the front hall . bob has little red-headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle has been in town before with a non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night . and lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues . got that ? good , because half of that stuff never gets explained . the only things that get worked out are the little red-headed girl \\'s identity and the identity of the killer ( neither of which are that hard to figure out ) . there are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film ( the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand , the photograph that changes with each viewing ,

vista . i was initially excited to get a computer that was running the newest operating system , and i hoped it would mean that my computer would have a much longer effective life . i have been nothing but disappointed since receiving this machine , especially knowing that had i called dell , they would have installed xp instead . pros : -better security ( it prompts me & allows me to stop some of the annoying \" automatic \" programs that software makers sneak onto your system ) -better appearance ( this is strictly cosmetic , and i \\'d rather stare at an ugly screen that worked rather than a pretty , useless one ) cons : -freezing : i use this computer 2-3 hours a day and i can expect 1-2 freezes / day . restarting often fails , and i have to cut the power and restart again . -display problems : although the cosmetics of the program were better , vista ca n\\'t display anything right . i tried updating the display driver which caused a major crash after restarting . i had to boot in safe mode and rollback the driver to get my computer back . apparently , the newest display drivers are incompatible with vista . -incompatibility : entirely too many programs are incompatible with vista , including some fairly big ones ( lots of adobe software , ipods , display drivers , etc. ) i know vista is new , and these software companies are slow to adapt , but does it really make sense for an operating system like vista to render virtually all of my other software obsolete ? why ca n\\'t vista play nicely with the other kids ? -its slow ! ! ! - - part of the reason i bought a new , state-of-the-art computer was to replace my old laptop ( which still runs ok , but has become a little buggy & sluggish in the past 4 years ) . although this computer is light years ahead of the old one , it actually runs even slower than my old laptop . technical support has largely attributed this to the demands of vista . bottom line : 1. if you are not good with computers , avoid vista like the plague 2. vista is a rip-off . save your money and keep / get xp- - i \\'m probably going to return my computer and make the manufacturer install xp so i can regain some speed and system stability . maybe in the future vista will work ok , but not right now.. . 3. the incompatibility issues- - though there are several- - conspicuously include problems with mac-oriented software

except for the total cholesterol , all the other tests were off . the manual states to check for the blue color at the back of the test strips after the test is done . except for total cholestrol the

do-all \" eurocam \" for an upcoming trip to europe . it promised a sufficient range of performance and features to easily meet our needs on such a trip . sadly , the camera is not up to filling this role . we will need to take another camera along with it . however , we will take the v705 for its wide-angle lens , the reason that we picked this model in the first place . it is this disparity between the advertised and actual capabilities of the camera which prompts me to contribute this review . the need for a true wide-angle lens is both a sufficient and a necessary condition for buying this camera . if you do not need a 23mm lens , or if you do not know if you need a 23mm lens , then you do not need this otherwise mediocre p&s ( point and shoot ) camera . good : fairly decent 23mm wide-angle lens ; the 23mm is the default lens ; rapid start-up time ; internal focus and zoom ; chromatic aberration well controlled ; can use 4gb cards ; freeze-frame and extract any video frame . mediocre : soft images ; perceptible shutter lag ; slow shot-to-shot times ; exposure compensation is easy , but steps are too small for digital , and is reset when camera turned off ; flash does not come close to covering the 23mm ; image numbering basically limited to 4 digits ; flimsy construction ; no manual controls ; no raw format ; no optical viewfinder ; histogram on display , but too small to be useful . bad : the absolute worst menu system to be found on a camera ; excessive and unadjustable jpeg compression ; poor battery life with very expensive external charger and spare battery ; unacceptable visual noise starting at asa-400 ; forced in-camera stitching of panoramic images , with inability to save the individual panoramic shots ; panoramic component images forced to 5mp ; overlays for panoramic and delete modes are so dark they obscure the underlying image ( even with display on ` bright \\' ) ; mpeg-4 video compression gives very poor results . synopsis : if you need a 23mm lens in a point and shoot , this , and the older v570 , are the only choices . if most of your images are in bright light , the 7mp v705 gives better images . if most images will be in low light , the older , cheaper , 5mp v570 is the better choice . the camera seems very fragile . treat it gently and you will likely be happy with the wide-angle performance . if you chose this as your sole camera , you will likely be unhappy with your choice . the only reason to buy this camera is for the wide-angle lens . = = = = = some expanded comments = = = = = twenty-three mm wide-angle fixed-focus lens . this lens has almost decent optical quality ; though the camera \\'s processing still produces overly-compressed and soft images from it . on power-up the 23mm is the initially active lens , which is ideal for us . however , considering that this is truly a specialty lens , it would make more sense that the ` normal \\' lens should be the default . best would be a menu setting to allow selection of the boot-up lens . better yet would be a camera with only the 23mm lens . the camera does have firmware wide-angle distortion correction . this works fairly well , at the cost of even more image softness , but even-so , barrel distortion is noticeable to a degree that is not present in actual 35mm-film camera wide-angle lenses of similar focal length . this in-camera correction can be turned off . doing so allows one to see the marginal native lens performance . however , being able to turn off distortion correction exemplifies for me how poorly thought out this camera is . the only people who would wish to do this are those who are exploring the artistic limits of the camera - and they would seem better served by the camera having such basics as : manual settings , a physically larger sensor chip , raw image files , or , at least , a choice of degree of jpeg compression . at the other end of the camera \\'s focal length the 114 / 117mm performance shows slightly below average image softness with average pincushion distortion . there are very few circumstances where one would want to use ` digital zoom \\' , so , as with all digicams , the claimed maximum telephoto length is completely bogus . after reaching optical zoom limits , one is much better off doing any further \\' zooming \\' in an editing program . kodak \\'s advertised \" 5x optical zoom \" is , at best , misleading . actually , it is just flat out untrue . the camera has two lenses . the only lens that can be optically zoomed is the 39-114mm lens , which is not quite 3:1. the wide angle lens has a fixed focal length . ( note , in some places kodak claims 39-114 , in others 39-117 optical zoom . ) also misleading is the claimed \" anti-blur technology . \" as best i can tell from looking at the images , and at the exif metadata , all this actually means is that at some given shutter speed the camera boosts the asa . certainly there is no optical image stabilization technology in this camera . speaking of asa . this is an opportune time to address the camera \\'s incredibly poor menu system . it is byzantine : being both awkward and time consuming to use . to adduce , ` auto \\' asa ranges from 50-200 , to set a faster ( or to lock in at a slower ) sensitivity rating requires going through multiple menu levels . to change from ` auto \\' to the next fastest ( 400 ) requires 11 manipulations of 2 controls ! on either of the other two p&ss which we will be taking along it requires 4 pushes on 1 control . the menu system is next to unusable in the field . still on asa settings , the camera does have sensitivities up to asa / iso 1000 ( though the manual only documents asas up to 800 , 1000 is available on the camera ) . unless your shot is of a once-in-a-lifetime , will never-happen-again moment , then 200 is the max asa tolerable before noise in the shadows becomes annoying . at 400 the entire image suffers from noise and is not really useable for any print larger than 4x5 \" . the previous version of this camera , v570 , had only 5mp , but the same sensor size . by increasing the pixel count , but not the physical size of the sensor , the new v705 camera actually has more low-light digital noise than its predecessor . this has happened with many of the current p&s cameras , as the makers advertise pixel count as a measure of image quality . my initial experience with low-light high asa use of this camera is that you might as well set the capture size to 3 mp , as the larger files have only marginally better printing capability because of the severe noise artifact . another approach to dealing with the sensor noise is to use one of the commercially available products which , when calibrated to the sensor in the camera , allows the subtraction of much of the internally generated noise . doing so does allow for semi-adequate 8x10 \" prints at asa 800. if one really wants to get carried away , combining the preceding with any of the image stacking programs designed for astrophotography ( where dozens / hundreds / thousands of images are averaged together ) makes 8x10 \\'s at asa 1000 doable . people willing to undertake these manipulations likely do not fit kodak \\'s target market . back to earth . the v705 \\'s still-image quality is below average for this generation of 7mp p&s cameras . mostly i believe this is because of the overly aggressive jpeg compression , which is not adjustable ( e.g. ` best \\' , ` good \\' , etc ) . my guess is that a compression setting of 30-40 is being used . this results in small files , with a lot of compression artifact . the 7mp jpegs from this camera are about 1.2-1.5mb in size , those from another 7mp p&s i have are 5-6mb . my 6mp prosumer digital slr jpegs are 8-10mb . the more the compression , the worse the image . most cameras allow the user to pick the trade-off point . kodak picks it for you , and picks poorly . the v705 \\'s video performance is very disappointing . it uses mpeg-4 compression , and at very aggressive compression settings . unless it is a video of your baby \\'s first steps , or aliens landing in the backyard , you will likely find it hard to watch . the total output datastream is about 0.5 mbs . compare this with a minidv tape video datastream of 25 mbs ( total , adding sound , error correction , and time codes , is 36 mbs ) . better to have stuck with mpeg-2 which would give less compression , but decent enough ( tv quality ) videos . that is the choice that most manufactures have made . as a result , the videos from my other p&ss have about a 2 mbs datastream , and so are of much better quality . the battery . kodak \\'s claim is 150 still images per charge . i am getting 100-120 , with minimal use of flash and the lcd on ` energy saver\\' . even 150 would be poor , compared with my other digital p&ss , where i expect at least 200 , and often get 250+ if i am at all careful with power-management . this camera has a proprietary ( and hard to remove ) 720 mah battery . my ( several ) other , p&ss have 790-1120 mah batteries , and , i suspect , more efficient processors . since we are only going to be using this camera for wide-angle , the battery will likely last most of a day . we have not bought an external charger and backup battery because the cost is about 25% the cost of the camera . though the body is of aluminum , the camera itself is overall fragile and i doubt will hold up more than a year or two . the battery and media doors do not appear to have been designed for actual repeated use ; there is no cover for the charge socket . the media door often dislodges open . truly , my belief is that kodak designed this camera with the thought that these doors would never be used : that the camera would spend its life simply being taken in and out of the ( not included in this model ) \" easyshare \" dock system . this would also explain the relatively large amount of built in memory , and the overly aggressive jpeg compression . shutter lag , the bête noire of digital cameras , is very evident with this model . i do not have any method of actually measuring the time between pressing the shutter , and the image being recorded . however , based on over 50 years of tripping shutters , it clearly varies , and i estimate is , at best 1 / 4 second , up to a bit over 1 / 2 second . in addition to the shutter lag , there is a perceptible lag in the lcd viewfinder screen showing what is in front of the lens . together this makes the capture of a fleeting moment , an active child at a particular instant , or a wary animal almost impossible . the shutter lag is much more evident than in same-generation / price p&s cameras from other makers . the accompanying ` manual \\' is poorly organized , childishly written . \" finish reading this book , so you can take and share your best pictures ! \" at best , it was written for 8 year olds . the manual does make reference to a web-address where one can download the ` full manual \\' , however the address given is incorrect . when eventually found , the manual is better than the one enclosed with the camera - in that it contains some information that one could not figure out oneself - but it also is written at no more than a fourth grade level . panoramics , one of the advertising points of the camera , are another disappointment . basically the way it works is that 2 or 3 images can be taken in ` panoramic mode \\' , each subsequent shot is overlain by a thin strip of the preceding image , in order to allow alignment . as with most ` panoramic modes \\' focus and exposure is locked on the first image . so far , this is all ok ; however , it rapidly goes downhill . first , the max image size of the individual shots is limited to 5 ( not 7 ) mp . next , the image overlay is so dark that , even with the lcd set at max brightness , it is difficult to see through the mask to align the elements . however , it gets worse . the images must be joined in-camera ! the individual images cannot be stored ! in-camera processing is very slow and very battery hungry . aligning the overlaps on a grainy 1.5x2 \" lcd in the field gives , in spite of the camera \\'s best efforts , much poorer results than aligning them on a much bigger , and higher quality , computer display in the comfort and controlled lighting of your home . the best way to take panoramas with this camera is to use a lightmeter to determine exposure for each segment , and then simply take the appropriate series of images as 7mp single-stills , making exposure compensation adjustments based on your light-meter readings . of course , my smallest lightmeter is almost as large as this camera , so we will not be dragging it along . you can eyeball the needed ec close enough that should be able to match the exposures up in production . much better if the v705 allowed the individual images to be saved . reading back through this review , i see that it is mostly negative . this makes sense , for , as i disclosed at the beginning , it was my disappointment in this camera \\'s actual vs advertised capability which led me to write the review in the first place . likely i have said all that needs to be said . so i will just close by mentioning that the only reason we did not send the camera back is because of the wide-angle lens . except for this unique lens , the camera \\'s performance and ease of use is below that of similarly priced p&s cameras currently on the market . if you need a true wide-angle p&s , you need this camera . otherwise forget it \\r\\n', ' if you do not yet own dark side of the moon , wish you were here and the wall , do not even consider purchasing a momentary lapse of reason . amlor is junk by comparison . that said , very few rock albums ever made can hang with those three , and amlor certainly has its bright spots . \" learning to fly \" and \" on the turning away \" are as good as anything pink floyd has

a great headache reliever , or a medication that treats mild strains , sprains , toothaches , etc. it also acts to reduce fever . acetaminophen is commonly used in place of aspirin for those allergic to aspirin . one drawback of acetaminophen is that it does not reduce inflammation ( therefore , it has limited use in arthritis swelling reduction ) . it has few side-effects . those with liver disease should avoid acetaminophen , as it is hard on the liver . tylenol ( acetaminophen ) came into great prominence when aspirin fell out of favor due to the incidence of reye \\'s syndrome and aspirin in children . tylenol is the manufacturer \\'s proprietary name for acetaminophen . there is a generic form of acetaminophen that is also sold over the counter , and this version is much cheaper than \" tylenol \" , and the container usually contains more tablets / pills , etc. the generic form of acetaminophen is just as effective as tylenol , just cheaper priced . sometimes acetaminophen is combined with other medications for dual action . for example , tylenol pm has diphenhydramine ( the active ingredient in benadryl ) , which causes sedation and acts like a good sleeping pill . diphenhydramine also is an anti-histamine , so it work for itching and allergies too . tylenol is packaged in different strengths : extra-strength at 500 mg per tablet , standard ( 325 mg per tablet ) , and children \\'s dose of 80 mg . tylenol may also be packaged in a timed-release version , called \" extended release \" . rather than the tablet dissolving all at once in the stomach , the tablet slowly releases acetaminophen throughout the digestive tract . all in all , acetaminophen is a great product . if you want a \" name brand \" of acetaminophen , tylenol is your brand ( although it will cost more ) . my choice is to by the generic brand as it is cheaper by the dozen . jim \" konedog \" koenig \\r\\n', ' i inhaled this cd . after all the hype and hyper blowin

this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer . this movie is not bram stoker 's dracula , but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story . if it was named something else

watch the silent film nosferatu . nosferatu is the only dracula movie that gets the story right . dracula is a monster , he 's not a star crossed lover at all and was n't intended to be . people wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply is n't one . it 's a horror tale , not a vieled porn book , and certainly not a love story . if anything the ones that fail to understand dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him \\r\\n\", ' so i did the unthinkable . i put windows vista business on my mac- -specifically my mac mini . it works great , no system slow downs and no crashes . the mac handles vista beautifully . i had no problems using boot camp 1.2 in order to install it . the mac drivers for vista ( included with boot camp ) all worked fine . the vista installation took all of about 30 minutes including some updates and such . i had windows xp home on my mac b4 and while it worked well , vista business works much more smoothly . as you may or may not know a mac mini is not exactly a powerhouse computer . i have a 1.66 gigahertz core duo with 1gb of ram on it . it displays the aero interface perfectly especially hooked up to my 32 inch widescreen lcd tv . seems even the lowest cost mac can still make vista shine while most pcs cant . one disclaimer tho . all intel macs can run vista ultimate without a hitch except the mac mini ( which can only go up to business / home premium ) while vista is still behind os

mari\\x1arent et eurent beaucoup d\\'enfants \" ( \" happily ever after \" ) is a cleverly written examination of contemporary views on love , lust , marriage , infidelity , and the single life . writer / director / actor yvan attal has come up with a winner , an entertaining , funny , and ultimately thoughtful treatise on how we cope with partnering . three men work together in a car dealership . vincent ( yvan attal ) is the apparently happily married man with a beautiful wife gabrielle ( charlotte gainsbourg ) and child . georges ( alain chabat ) on the other hand is in a tumultuous marriage with nathalie ( emmanuelle seigner ) who has gender issues that go far beyond feminism and negatively influence their child . fred ( alain cohen ) is single , bedding every lovely woman he encounters , balancing trysts between mornings , afternoons , and evenings and is deeply envied for his don juanism . but fred actually longs for the sense of belonging that married men enjoy . the men \\'s lives intertwine on many levels . most important , we discover that vincent has a lover ( angie david ) despite his idyllic married life and while it is georges whom one would expect to seek solace from a lover , he remains faithful to his nagging wife ! gabrielle senses vincent \\'s affair and encounters a sexy man in a music shop ( johnny depp ) who begins to preoccupy her thoughts . she is a real estate broker and comes close to an assignation with a client but remains faithful . all the while she daydreams about her brief encounter with depp and satisfies her wandering eye with those memories . fred discovers that one of his paramours is pregnant and happily decides to leap into the married fray . the only \\' adults \\' sharing advice here are vincent \\'s long married parents ( anouk aim\\x1ae and claude berri in very welcome comeback cameos ! ) and it is this \\' standard \\' that adds the final humor to the film . the manner in which all three men deal with their living situations asks as many questions as it gives answers . attal finds joy in all forms of coupling and is careful to offer all sides of decisions his characters make in arriving at what provides them happiness . this is a smart movie with terrific twists . there is just enough slapstick ( an all out food fight between vincent and gabrielle - real life husband and wife team attal and gainsbourg - that proves to be one of the fun-loving bits of silliness that binds their marriage ) to keep the mood light . not a profound film , but a joyous french comedy handled by total pros ! in french and english with subtitles . recommended . grady harp , october 0 \\r\\n', \" my wife and i , huge fans of ` america 's next top model ' and ` project runway ' , were very excited about seeing this film . why it took us this long still baffles me , but as of friday night we had the pleasure of seeing ` the devil wears prada ' and let me just say that it was quite the pleasure . now , most if not all the praise has been heaped on the shoulders of meryl streep , and while she was outstanding , this film is more than just a meryl painted canvas . there are four brilliant performances in this film and they all are deserving of praise . first is anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs , a young aspiring journalist who takes a job working as miranda priestly assistant at ` runway magazine' . anne hathaway proves with her performance that she 's all grown up . no , that 's not to take away from her more adult roles in more adult films like ` havoc ' and the masterpiece ` brokeback mountain ' , but here anne proves that she can do adult comedy , not falling back into her teen goofiness that made her famous in ` the princess diaries ' but keeping everything smart and mature . she has enough poise and grace to match wits with miranda , and she does so elegantly . next up is emily blunt who plays emily , miranda 's first assistant ( there are two , andrea being the second ) . emily has worked her butt off to get to where she is , slaving for the unruly priestly and it 's all about to pay off with a trip alongside miranda to paris . the only thing standing in her way is andrea , for if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly on emily . emily blunt turns out i think the best performance of the bunch for she has enough sass , enough attitude and enough wit to make her pop out from the screen and stand out no matter who is sharing the screen with her . stanley tucci also does wonderfully here as nigel , miranda 's second in command . he is there to make sure everything is perfect , and also help andrea adjust . stanley always has done great backup work , playing second hand man to just about everyone , but here he really makes his performance his own and owns it . he delivers some of the funniest lines in the film but he never feels like the ` token gay guy' ...he 's needed in this film , not filler , and he commands his scenes and really stands out amidst the crowd . and then , of course , we have meryl streep who plays the ruthless tyrant known as miranda priestly . what i was most impressed about was the way meryl underplays every word , every emotion , every scene , which is not what i expected . i really expected her to go all glen close and reincarnate cruella but she did n't ( thankfully ) and instead turned out one of the most inspired performances of the year . she must have had fun playing the snooty self absorbed and above all selfish editor-in-chief of ` runway' . she lets us see inside her character briefly ( when crying over another failed marriage ) but her character is more about shutting off feeling in order to succeed and so we do n't get to see the real miranda because we 're not supposed to . carried by these four brilliant performances ` the devil wears prada ' is a fabulous film that will make you laugh and make you smile and will impress almost anyone . the script is brilliantly adapted from lauren weisberger 's novel , and while it 's not an exact replica ( are any adaptations these days ? ) it carries the same wit but smoothes things out to make it more approachable and , in my eyes , more enjoyable . bravo \\r\\n\", \" if you love ludlum 's over-the-top novels ( and i do ) , the matarese circle has to be up there with the best . not all of ludlum 's books are a good match of plot and style - - the repeated & quot ; oh my god ! & quot ; declamations of one character after another can get silly when the goings-on are n't as riveting as they could be ( the two bourne sequels suffer from this problem , i think . ) but circle delivers on all fronts . part one is a masterpiece all by itself - - the intricate cat-and-mouse game between talienkov and scofield plays out thrillingly . and these are two of ludlum 's most believably drawn characters ; we feel empathy for both , and root for them to join forces from the get-go . antonia gravet , the inevitable gorgeous heroine / love interest who surfaces in part two , brings a well-crafted and believable backstory to the plot . one final bonus : some of ludlum 's zestiest minor characters appear in this book , adding to the fun in nearly every chapter . \\r\\n\", \" i read several different on-line reviews for this cd before i purchased it . each seemed to imply that this cd was a new direction for jaci , that her lyrics were bolder and the overall sound was much more independent in nature . strange . i must have purchsed the prozac copy of this cd because there is nothing new here from her . like my title line to this review states , it 's the exact same music she has always sang , just in a different package . now the cd just collects dust . what a shame \\r\\n\", ' this film is one big joke : you have all the basics elements of romance ( love at first sight , great passion , etc. ) and gangster flicks ( brutality , dagerous machinations , the mysterious don , etc. ) , but it is all done

then you probably wo n't be thinking about buying this lens anyway , as you 'll be off to purchase a nice l series . however , if - like me - you just happen to have a nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) and enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens will probably work out very well for you . i 've taken well over 1000 pictures with it in a couple of weeks , and it has performed very much as expected . for the price , it 's perfect for a go-everywhere lens . a few main points . okay , it 's not the best image quality . even on low / medium iso it seems a little grainy and its not as sharp as some of the more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you have a good flash unit , but for well-lit outdoor shoots it 's works very well . of course , it would be nice to have a nice l series with is , but if you ca n't afford that then this is a very good value lens . not for the real professionals , but great if you do n't take things too seriously and just want a

problems that i see in other feedback . 1 ) the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate . in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around . 2 ) it directed me to make turns onto one-way streets in the wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away 4 ) it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination 5 ) it does n\\'t provide a chime when it \\'s time for a turn . it will tell you the turn is a half-mile ahead , but that might be the last time you hear an instruction . 6 ) in one case , it got me to my destination ( at least close enough ) but could n\\'t guide me back to my starting point . the gps receiver

this lens around for a day - - in my hands or in a bag - - even with a 1.4 extender attached . it can feel a bit heavy but i do n't mind , and neither will you when you see the results later on . i 've used this a lot for shooting professional baseball and it 's landed me front page ink several times . in my mind , i could get the 1.4 extender with this lens and give myself a 70-280 range , which is pretty adequate for most sports and nature photography , considering the 300 f / 2.8 and it 's friends are much , much more expensive . the lens works basically just as fast and sharp , in my opinion , with the 1.4 at f / 4 , although some may debate this . flip on any baseball or football game and you will see this lens around the neck of most every pro . if you can swing the price , enjoy it ! my advice is to continue reading up on this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this is one of the finest lens around . it 's one that makes people stop and stare

n't allow me to uninstall nor reload it again . had to obtain a removal tool from their web site and it promptly removed every symantec product on the machine . maybe this was the writing on the wall ? by now i 'm a couple days into the drama . meanwhile , the first xp machine that loaded fine did another automatic update and guess what . it locked up half way through . now it will not run and had to be removed the same way . so i am now the proud owner of zonealarm 's internet suite . it cost less than the nav ( both 5 user versions ) , and loaded much faster . ten minutes and i was done , where it was an hour into nav when things worked and it loaded . i am taking this up with symantec and trying to get a refund . they can keep it . i 've been less satisfied with every upgrade and this one finally broke the camel 's back . maybe i 'll try again someday if i come up with a new camel , but they do n't grow well in seattle . added 3-12-2007 : i have also noted that after removing nav that things i could not explain before have been cured . for instance , the web site [...] would not load many of it 's pages correctly , they would show the text coding instead of html . now that i am nav free , all of the pages on this site load with no problems . hmmmm. . \\r\\n\", ' i was expecting to see a decent film by bava , but after having seen about 5 of his films , i can only guess that is he is a very good stylist but he lacks the capability to engage us with a story or to even scare us . most of his films are gorgeous to behold but they are vapid and have no story , this film is just like all the rest . there is no point to any of it , there is no plot and hardly any suspense , suffice it to say it might be interesting for a 12 year old horror goof but to an adult , its quite tedious . chris lee is rather banal also , he does n\\'t do much and it seems that he dubbed his own voice in the studio , most of the cast is rather dull also , supposedly playing some ancient noble family , they look more like 1960 \\'s mop heads and morons who were on too much acid . the dialogue , what there is , is crude , probably written by a drunk italian because there are so many mistakes , one example was when lee was whipping the lady on the beach and she says , \" i ca n\\'t have more ice cream ! \" so , i would suggest renting \" planet of the vampires \" because that is more enjoyable than this waste . interesting character to note was \" lesmo \" , dubbed as the \" european peter lorre \" who does n\\'t have much in the way of presence or acting skills and he looks like a cross between a frog and a midget . \\r\\n', ' this program does exactly as i expect . i am very pleased \\r\\n', \" i 've had these clippers for a little over a month now and they are by far

all the way up all it takes is a little pressure and the blade goes all the way down . tightening the screw did n't help either . the attachments do n't fit right , especially the blend attachment . this attachment can only be used if you do n't mind the feeling of having the hair ripped out of your head because all it does is pull . the only good thing about these clippers is that its cordless

lasts for about a month ) . i would have to say that i am extremely disappointed , particularly with the grainy images and completely out of focus edges . even with all the settings on the highest possible quality on the powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it 's incredible how blurry the edges are and surprised why no one has mentioned it being so obvious , especially the other reviewer being a pro photographer . so blurry that i had to use photoshop to crop out the left and right sides . the right side was worse than the left making 1 / 8th of the entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one with a bad lens . in any case , no thanks , i 'll stick with my trusty old camera . i would rather pay for a new smartmedia card each month .

this album did n't move me the first time , i decided to hang back and try again in a few days . then again . and again . and one more time . usually after three or four complete spins ( which was like work , with this one ) the jems will work there way to the surface . sufjian stevens was like that . so was z by my morning jacket . but the problem was that i really wanted to like this one . all the reviews i read were hyping this as the album of the decade , and i wanted them to be right . unfortunately , none of them were right . it is a plodding , lifeless album wanting desperately to be ' hip ' and failing miserably , to the point of being embarassing almost . like your 40 something hipster college prof with a graying ponytail ( who will love this , by the way ) , it will be pointless to argue with those who like this album . i have to say that it is obvious these guys put a lot of work into this , and they do have talent ; it just does n't get me there . i hope they can

the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records . i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers- -lyle lovett - \" lungs \" ( among others ) and steve earle - \" tecumseh valley \" . i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording . other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes \\' records . i come from a different angle . as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise , i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings . i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive . \\r\\n', ' in the past , i have considered amazon to be one of the better and more reliable online shopping websites . to be perfectly honest , i am no longer sure . two months ago , i bought this camera set from 47th st photo that was being sold on amazon . this camera set was called the 1 gb stylus 720 sw kit . ironically , the case did not fit the camera and the card reader did not even support 1 gb cards ! my first thought was that 47th st photo made an oversight with the accessories . two weeks after receiving the kit , i emailed 47th st photo to inform them of the mistake . after waiting a few weeks for a response , i decided to send them a second email . again , no response . by this point , i felt helpless and turned to amazon for aid . surprisingly , amazon was not much better than 47th st photo . minutes after sending the email to amazon , i received an automatic email informing me that amazon had received my email . that was the last i heard from amazon . more than two months have passed and i have not heard from either company \\r\\n', \" save your money on this one . it 's sooooooo bland - with no jams ! what a disappointment . can i get a refund \\r\\n\", ' when i discovered the existence of this novel , i was enthusiastic and intrigued . unfortunately , my hopes were more or less dashed as i trundled my way through the 382 pages . kleopatra focuses on the famous queen \\'s early years - a period of time of which we have no record - and the intrigues that haunted and led to the demise of any semblance of a family ( something she may have compensated for in adulthood ) . what i liked : 1 ) . the spelling of kleopatra / cleopatra with a \" k \" - it really does emphasize that hellenistic connection ; 2 ) kleopatra \\'s strength of character - essex \\'s general characterization is appropriate and it \\'s easy to see what kleopatra will become . although the novel is a noble attempt by karen essex , it just did n\\'t work for me . the character of berenike as an amazon seemed a bit far-fetched . and although i loved kleopatra \\'s love interest ( i wo n\\'t give away his name ! ) , i felt it was a bit far-fetched as well , almost as if essex was pressured into a love story from the publisher or something . kleopatra \\'s dionysian rites were also a little hard to believe , as was mohama . there were also scenes of random sex that were a bit.. . unnecessary . overall , although kleopatra was a strong , believable character , she was in the minority . the novel as a sort of back-story to the queen of egypt did n\\'t work as it was weighed down by the elements of fiction ! at least the sequel is better . for fiction that works , check out the memoirs of cleopatra by margaret george . \\r\\n', ' over the years at various jobs , i have seen this flashlight several times . it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse . it may end up looking beat up and yucky , but they always work , no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it . if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox , work truck , pick-up glove compartment , etc. , this is the only one you need . if you need a good flashlight at home , and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store , this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy . i finally bought one just for my home , and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago ( i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox ; i refuse to replace it ) . i like this version because it has a strong magnet , and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck . i also like that it has switch guards , so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath 25# of stuff in your toolbox . one nit-picky complaint . it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector . however , it comes empty and you have to supply your own , so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight . \\r\\n', \" i have six children and had been feeling extremely fatigued ( like i could hardly move ) . i had been taking a general multi-vitamin from a local

what they said was that katy ca n\\'t rock just yet because she \\'s a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme . i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night . the first problem is that her voice just is n\\'t that strong , secondly , her lyrics never come out as if they \\'re honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say . throughout her set , there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing ( passingly honest as well ) and that was \" snowflake . \" it \\'s fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she \\'s lived in california for a long time , but she hates warm weather , sounds impossible , but she must be truthful because it \\'s the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft . i \\'m sure she has potential for the future , but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who \\'s known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop . stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out , and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record \\r\\n', ' i mean come on , who needs 5 blades right ? well , after thoughtful consideration of the major improvement that the mach iii was over a twin head razor , i decided that $10 was worth the price of a cheap thrill so i took the plunge , and to my

me a much closer shave than the mach iii , and with very little effort , and those tight spots that my old razor would always miss are not a problem anymore . and i find this razor to be very

the first review i have written in probably a few years . normally , i do n\\'t feel strongly enough about any product , good or bad , to bother entering a review . with this new version of quicken , i have something that i feel strongly enough to write about . i have been using quicken for close to 20 years . i have built all of my finances around it . for the past 6 years , quicken has been going steadily downhill . this latest version , i hope , represents rock bottom . i do n\\'t see how the product could possibly get any worse . words cannot describe how bad this product is . no functionality has been added in the previous 6 years . what has happened is that the screen has become more cluttered with more links to quicken \\'s \" financial partners \" , and more redundant links to other , old , program features , and more white space . in return , the user has to page through tab after tab after tab to view the same information that previously fit on only 1 screen . further , each screen refresh now takes seconds , whereas in older versions a screen refresh was instantaneous . entering a simple transaction may require this bloated sofware to generate 2 , 3 , even 4 complete screen refreshes , each one taking maybe 1 to 2 seconds . that means , once you hit the \" enter \" key to complete a transaction , you can be waiting as long as 8 seconds before you can move on to entering the next transaction . as little as 3 years ago the same step required less than a second . obviously , time required will vary with your computer - but it is bad enough that quicken now requires you to \" downgrade \" your quicken software every few years - it is also necessary for you to replace your entire computer system at the same time just so you can realize the same performance level as you had in the previous version . all of this with no additional features or functionality . there is a new kid on the block that i am switching to . it is called \" moneydance \" . it can import data from quicken , it is fast , compact , and runs on any platform , windows , linix , unix , mac , even os / 2. it is easier to use than quicken and the support is great . it is available for download - a functional evaluation version is free and the full version is only $30. you can actually speak to a person to get help w / out having to pay . since i have been using quicken for years , it will take a while to test mondeydance out to make sure it works properly . i am running the 2 side-by-side for a while to make sure the numbers agree . so far , things are going well . then i plan to dump quicken forever . the well has run dry at quicken ; everyone who made the product great has apparently left the company . obviously the people at quicken are free to make their product as bloated and as cumbersome as they want . but they should not be allowed to force people to downgrade . yet , that is what they are doing . i am absolutely positively through with quicken , and i am not coming back \\r\\n', ' alright , so her childhood was a bit different than your average white middle-income childhood . should this motivate anybody to write a

find an \" international \" jewel like jhumpa lahiri \\'s \" the namesake \" or zadie smith \\'s \" on beauty \" , you will be greatly disappointed . if you are into africa , read something that has

about 3 times more than this lens , and although it is very clear and the extra reach is nice at times especially since it can be used with both the 1.4x and 2x tc 's , it is very difficult to use inside without a tripod . the 60mm can be handheld if needed with very good results even if you have to bump your iso up a little to do so . i have also used this lens for both inside and outside

antarctic drill into a hollow rock formation and disturb the ten-million-plus slumber of 80-foot hungry reptile . there \\'s nothing more to this film than that . \" boa \" ( also known as \" new alcatraz \" ) actually takes itself seriously instead of reveling in its silliness , which i do n\\'t think was a smart idea . the technical team - photography , production design-set decoration , etc. - create a fairly effective , chilling atmosphere , but everything else about \" boa \" is strictly routine . dean cain does a job i would describe as tolerable , although elizabeth lackey is just that - lacking - as his wife , and the supporting cast ( mark sheppard , grand l . bush , craig wasson ) is just a touch more professional . the film-makers actually make the wise move of mostly keeping the snake in the dark so we ca n\\'t see just how fake it looks . i do n\\'t really recommend it unless you actually happen to enjoy this sort of thing to begin with ; other , similar titles include \" python \" 1 and 2 , \" anaconda \" ( the original hokey animated killer snake movie of 1997 ) and \" anaconda : search for the blood orchid \" , and the inevitable \" boa vs. python \" . the dvd includes a few trailers and filmographies for the director and principal actors . 2 / \\r\\n', ' i received \" aerial \" last december , and it still amazes me . the music soars and sweeps , carrying the listener along on its wings . it is a work of genius , and those who are long-time kate bush fans will find that it was well worth waiting twelve years for this masterpiece to arrive ! this two-disc set offers the listener two different experiences , in my opinion . the first disc , \" a sea of honey \" is comprised of sort of stand alone pieces , first of which is \" king of the mountain , \" probably the most \" commercially appealing \" song on the album . \" king of the mountain \" sucks the listener in with deep , murky tones and kate \\'s voice easing into the song softly , building in intensity as the song progresses . \" king of the mountain \" is followed by songs like \" pi \" ( who else but kate bush could make the derivation of pi sound so sexy ? ) and \" bertie , \" a lovely elizabethan paean to her young son . then there are emotionally raw songs like \" mrs. bartolozzi \" and \" a coral room , \" the latter of which is about kate \\'s late mother . the reclusive ms. bush teases the listener about the struggle for anonymity in \" how to be invisible , \" and sings in reference to joan of arc in \" joanni . \" after being captivated by songs about famous people , and more down-to-earth personal struggles / triumphs , the listener comes to the second disc , titled \" a sky of honey . \" this is , in my opinion , the piï¿½ce de rï¿½sistance of \" aerial . \" this disc is a continuous journey of sound , taking the listener on an amazing voyage punctuated by- -among other things- -the sounds of birds , the sound of her child \\'s voice , and kate bush \\'s silky voice singing in italian . the disc is almost indescribably beautiful , in my opinion . i love the way \" a sky of honey \" takes me out of myself when i hear it . i feel like i am flying at points ; becoming one with the soaring birds . my personal favorite on \" a sky of honey \" is \" nocturn , \" a surreal nighttime romp on the beach , accompanied by thumping bass and showcasing the pure magic of kate bush \\'s voice . the disc \\'s final ( and title ) track \" aerial \" is a forceful climax to the sonic journey , and ends with bush singing : \" i want to be up on the roof i \\'ve gotta be up on the roof up , up high on the roof up , up on the roof in the sun \" it is as though kate bush has reached new heights and has taken the listener along for the trip . what an absolutely magnificent acheievement this disc is ! to kate bush fans , i cannot recommend this album highly enough . true , it was a very long wait for this new cd , but , ms. bush has rewarded her fans duly ; indeed it is almost like she released two separate albums at once with this two-disc triumph ! if you are a kate bush devotee , you will not be disappointed ! and , if you are new to kate bush , \" aerial \" will be a great introduction to her genius . kate bush is like no other artist i can name . her voice is incredibly versatile ; she can mold it to sound like an angel or a banshee , a temptress or a child . and , so far in her career , it kate bush \\'s voice gets better with the passing of time . like a fine wine , one can savor it and contemplate its complexities endlessly . \" aerial \" is well , well worth listening to , and words alone cannot suffice to explain what a work of art it is . \\r\\n', \" together with ' odyssey into the minds eye ' , two of my

to be expected as the band grows and matures into the band it is now . each album progresses towards more epic scales , and songs balance beauty with power . \" i heard a voice \" captures this on film , and the fan gets to witness afi at their most grandiose . watching vocalist davey havok sing \" god called in sick today \" while being held up by the audience is amazing to watch and gives this reviewer chills everytime . the masterful command of theatrics from each member , especially havok , creates a powerful feeling unable to fully describe but easy to appreciate . the setlist itself is perfectly put together , with the only gripe being the exclusion of \" kiss and control . \" the rest of the songs display all facets of afi , from the fast paced \" dancing through sunday \" , ( which includes a nicely executed guitar solo by guitarist jade puget ) \" kill caustic \" , \" death of seasons \" , \" totalimmortal \" and \" a single second \" , ( the last of which features a guest appearance by nick 13 of tiger army ) to the slower paced \" this time imperfect \" and \" endlessly , she said \" as well as all of their recent singles , and a few more cuts from their latest releases \" decemberunderground \" and \" sing the sorrow \" . extras are geared towards the fans , with despair faction interviews and the inclusion of videos from their massive scavenger hunt prior to the decemberunderground release , as well as a poster . each band member has their moments to shine , and are all very capable and talented muscians . bassist hunter burgan and drummer adam carson lay down a solid foundation as well as background vocals , as puget layers his unique guitar sound and obvious mastery , in this genre , over the instrument . this is all built up to allow havok to use his unique vocal approach to wander in between melodies and notes , mixing powerful singing with a fantastic screaming voice , to create beautiful atmospheres of sound that can crash down on you just as easily as it hypnotizes you . the quality of the sound production as well as the video edits are fantastic . unlike other live dvd \\'s , where the concert is edited to the point of a music video , \" i heard a voice \" has just the right amount to not make you forget you are watching a live dvd , but also add to the overall effect of the performance . the sound is very clear , and the sound levels are perfectly set to allow each member to cut through the mix . this is overall a very stellar production , and fans who have already embraced the new direction of the band , as well as new fans and casual fans , should find the dvd to be quite entertaining and a very worthwhile buy \\r\\n', \" i just got my new camcorder and start to operate it . first of all is 's very easy to

the puzzle that ultimately paint him as a highly-trained government assassin . reason for the rating : violence and some language . based on the robert ludlum-authored book by the same name , the bourne identity is part action flick , part stylized thriller . in his first role as an erstwhile action hero , matt damon shines as bourne , imbuing the character with both an appropriate edginess and a comfortable-in-his-own-skin-even-though-he-doesn\\'t -know-who-he-is ease . as the story opens , bourne is pulled out of the mediterranean sea and treated for suspicious bullet wounds by the crew of an italian fishing boat . the \" hey , this is a story about espionage \" theme is introduced early as a crew member removes a tiny implant from bourne that displays what we later learn is a swiss bank account number . upon finding and opening the safe deposit box , bourne discovers multiple passports ( including one with the name jason bourne ) , a variety of foreign currency , and a gun . he then begins his search to uncover his true identity- -and until now , so does the audience . if there is one misstep in the bourne identity , it may be the fact that early scenes involving the cia and the agency \\'s frantic attempts to track him down give audience members the answer to bourne \\'s identity far earlier than bourne himself . at this point the film becomes more of a \" how will he survive ? \" thriller rather than a \" who am i ? \" mystery . a love interest of sorts ( played nicely by run lola run actress franka potente ) gives bourne a \" partner in crime \" to play off of for much of the movie , but her role seems more of a plot contrivance rather than a reasonable or logical plot development . an implied ( off-screen ) love scene for the two is just as implausible as it is brief , but does n\\'t detract too much from the action . the most interesting ( and morally significant ) moment in the film comes when bourne finally remembers who he is as well as the mission he was on . through this pivotal flashback ( and some foreshadowing that finally makes sense ) , we learn that the highly-trained killing machine is n\\'t capable of pulling the trigger upon seeing his assassination target \\'s children in the room with him . bourne \\'s hesitation nearly costs him his life and sets the course for the film \\'s premise as he is shot , falling into the mediterranean sea . smartly directed , the bourne identity is fast-paced without feeling rushed . the cinematographer paints the european setting in shades of grays and yellows , giving the movie a unique noir-like look that fits well with the drama . as an action film decorated with whodunit sensibilities , this film is a winner for older teens and adults . nappaland.com recommends : ignore the plot contrivances and just enjoy the ride- -the bourne identity is a worthy discovery . after the show...if members of your family choose to view this movie , use these questions to spark discussion about it afterward : - --what do you think prompted jason bourne to pause when he was preparing to shoot his assassination target on the yacht ? what does this say about bourne \\'s moral compass ? - --how would you feel if you suddenly could n\\'t remember who you were ? what actions would you take to discover your identity ? - --when faced with the horror of who he really is and what he has done , jason bourne longs for a chance to erase his past and start his life anew . when have you felt that way ? how can a relationship with jesus give us a \" second chance \" in the truest

's a wonderful life ( chapter 13 ) . in that chapter , i found three mistakes - not minor details , but major , provable points , including misquoting zuzu and misquoting the inscription in the book in the last scene - within four paragraphs . if eliot 's work is that shoddy in four paragraphs , how can i trust the rest of the information in the book ? avoid this at all costs ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! \\r\\n\", \" ( .... ) . it takes some getting used to , but after a couple of weeks it provides a very comfortable shave . i got razor burn on my neck for the first couple weeks , but i think i was pressing too hard like i had to with my old razor . just a light touch gives a close shave . the attachable sideburn trimmer does n't do a very good job in my opinion , but i kept my old razor that worked better for that purpose . the gel packs go pretty quickly , but maybe i 'm using too much . i 'm still trying to get the hang of it . it 's a different experience than your basic razor \\r\\n\", ' i \\'m not sure what compelled me to seek out \" americano , \" written and directed by kevin noland . it \\'s not as if i was dying to check up on the career of joshua jackson , a star of tv \\'s \" dawson \\'s creek . \" perhaps i was intrigued by dennis hopper \\'s inclusion in such a small scale production- -i mean the man is always interesting even when his material is less than stellar . here , however , the lure for him seems to have been his daughter ruthanna , who has a supporting role and serves as a producer on this film . maybe it was international star leonor varela , a beauty who is surely one good role away from making it big in america . most likely , though , it was the idea of seeing the movie as a travelogue of spain . with great scenery , bull fights , hemingway , hard drinking and partying , the running of the bulls- -the atmosphere alone might have made intriguing viewing . however , i am going to be rather hard in my assessment of this film . i think noland has talent and i look forward to other works . the film is photographed well and has good performances . my problem stems from the fact that there is absolutely no drama in this familiar coming-of-age story . with an astounding lack of real character insight , this little production about characters at a crossroads falls absolutely flat . the setup is simple . as recent college graduates , jackson and two pals ( who bicker comically ) are spending the last few days of their vacation in spain before jackson must return to the \" real \" world and a new job . facing the eternal struggles between childhood and adulthood , work and independence , freedom and monotony , dreams and reality- -jackson falls into lust with a local played by varela . should he ditch it all for this worldwind romance ? should he abandon responsibility for a life of leisure ? should he stay in spain ? these are legitimate questions and a legitimate , albeit familiar , story path . what makes \" americano \" so tedious and uninvolving , however , is that the film does n\\'t allow you to know its characters . a character study with no genuine character development seems a hard concept to pull off- -and \" americano \" does n\\'t succeed in doing anything remotely deeper than the superficial presentation of friends on vacation . we never know anything about jackson \\'s job or life in america , or his dreams , passions , interests , etc...aside from this fleeting romance . sure , the film goes through the requisite motions- -jackson writes pretentious poetry and talks to statues of hemingway , what else would you expect in spain ? if he has artistic aspirations , however , the screenplay surely never develops this . lacking any real guidance as to what jackson envisions for his life , i simply fell into the camp of \" who cares ? \" there are plenty of authentic moments in the depiction of spanish culture . dennis hopper \\'s role , however , as a club host is a complete misfire . ultimately , though , my genuine disinterest in the film comes from a screenplay that asks me to care but never goes beneath the surface for emotional truth and character depth . sure , jackson \\'s at a crossroads- -but lacking any understanding of what he wants , it made no difference to me what he chose . sorry , but that \\'s a big problem when it is your film \\'s central theme . kgharris , 02 / 07 \\r\\n', ' after watching \" harsh times \" we wondered \" is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life ? \" we could n\\'t believe what we were watching . it was meant to be the new 2006 version of \" training day \" - -they even got christian bale to play the lead role- -but only in the eyes of the people involved in it . it was a miscalculation and we \\'ll explain why . brief story : the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l.a. jim davis ( christian bale ) is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran . now in the states , he is looking for a job as a cop . jim \\'s best friend mike alonzo ( freddy rodríguez ) is also unemployed , but when his friend comes to visit , they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities- -selling drugs , guns , getting high just to name few . to spend time with his friend , mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia ( eva longoria ) making her believe that he is looking for a job . she does n\\'t know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face . review : \" harsh times \" has many problems , but the most notorious one is the crime \" video game \" feeling it has throughout the film . the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a \" grand theft auto \" or \" scarface : the world is yours \" video game adaptation with a little bit of \" cheech & chong \" in the mix . there is no climax- -we just see them driving to different places , arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end . christian bale \\'s accent in this movie does n\\'t help either , not only it changes through out the film , but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate . the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager-like- -also there is no chemistry between them . the acting in this movie is disappointing , especially from bale who we liked in movies like \" american psycho \" , \" batman returns \" and \" the prestige . \" it is clear that he was miscast this time . he just cannot do what denzel washington did in \" training day . \" because of his accent and terrible acting in this film , we believe this is his worst performance to date . this is something he does n\\'t want to add to his resume . the verdict : christian bale returns , but this new american psycho cannot find his equilibrium . \" harsh times \" tries too hard to create the edgy , dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that \" training day \" had , but it does n\\'t even come close to achieve that goal . we laugh at the silliness of the story , overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year . he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor . this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent . \\r\\n', \" the story here dose n't matter . the main characters fuse into a missle of meth and insanity towards an explosive ending . scwartzman escapes his fate temporarily and murphy is blessed with a reprieve but rourke pays the full price for his evil concoction , meth . quirky directing and film editing can be somewhat distracting but not meaningless . roberts is so gay you want to smack his face . he an rourke have history on film and play out their familiarity . rourke is phenomonal again as an immoral genius , a role he plays better than anyone today in film . br \\r\\n\", ' i liked everything about this product except it is a little too slow at times . i always shoot with nikon raw format . it has hung a couple of times and i had to kill it after waiting for 10-15 minutes . \\r\\n', ' this flash is the perfect back-up for a studio , or main / flash fill for an amateur studio . i use several w / slaves and lines and the images rival set-ups that cost thousands of dollars . i like that they are light and easy to pack and transport . they are reasonably priced . they have been around for a long time and do not have bells and whistles . the sunpak has auto / f-stop and manual . if you are a real photographer , you will know how to use them . the down side is that if your sunpak is plugged into a wall , it takes far too long to recharge ( sometimes 3-5 seconds ) . rechargeable batteries seem to work the best with 1-3 second recharge times between flashes . \\r\\n', ' i had boughten this as a gift which turned out to be an aweful idea . it is way too loud and the force of air is way too strong . it literally causes loss of hearing and causes your hair to look like you were just caught in a tornado . i do not recommend this hair dryer for anyone . \\r\\n', ' the pedometer arrive held prisoner in a difficult-to-open plastic cell - - what are these \" packaging engineers \" thinking ? it took me ten minutes and two ruined fingernails to open it , and then i took the scissors to it , and the hard packaging almost broke them ! but i was thrilled . a handsome object , thought i , and i loved the clip in the back that you pinch to open . so much better than having to wrestle it down over a soft waistband . i yanked out the plastic battery protector and set to work to rev the thing up to speed . but , alas , it would not follow instructions as they were written . \" press and hold the set button . hour display blinking . \" ( could they not have said , \" the hour display will blink \" ? i pressed . \" press memory button to adjust the hour . \" i did . the memory button never did a thing . so i asked a friend of mine to try and he had no luck either . we both tried several combinations of maneuvers , but nothing worked . to this moment , the hour display is blinking , blinking , blinking . i \\'d like to get my money back , but ya know what ? j & r music & computer world in ny demand such a rigamarole to send it back , including with all the original packaging ( i threw the op in the trash ) , that you almost have to be a genius in packaging to follow their instructions , which , of course , are not designed to benefit the consumer but to benefit only themselves . now i \\'m afraid this pedometer will follow its packaging into the trash , while i will make sure i never order from j&r again .
